  I have a valid splits.config file, but my scripts don't handle the single-volume case correctly, ignore it. This causes data pages not to be
         placed correctly at very end.

========================
highest priority for SN:
========================

In Op1, there are extra spaces between some hw problems. I can't
figure out why. No figures, just text.!?!?

arearh
 garbled text

add specific coaching on problem-solving to books, the kind of thing I do in lec and office hours:
  - algebra before numbers
  - checking units when purely symbolic; putting in units when evaluating numerically
  - checking physical behavior
  ...etc.

SN6 shouldn't start with biology lead about human vocal tract; is the physics in here even correct?
copy why the sky is blue from em into sn
put fish picture from VW4 into SN
 SN 11.6 needs a figure illustrating the derivation of the Poynting vector
add self-check to EM, SN, give equipot, find E, as in lab

motorcycle picture in NP is messed up, hard to read


Copy material from calc book into SN:
- iterated integrals
- cylindrical and spherical coords


copy solenoid-sex from lm.xml to sn.xml
LM had better version, may have overwritten with SN version, so
  check against printed copies


hw problems
   hydrogenlike has hardcoded ref to SN subsec
    ultrarelativistic is actually two different problems in LM, SN

EM now incorporates a table of atomic masses in the text. They need the atomic masses in order
to do one of the homework problems (neon sign). Do the same in SN8, and use include mechanism.


Make it easier to do only part of SN 8.2 in 222.

-------------------

hard SN hw for ch. 8 (?):
  extend elliptical orbit analysis to repulsive force, prove cross-section goes like 1/sin4 (?)

add Pound-Rebka photos and description to SN 7.3
  photos:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound-Rebka_experiment

example for NP5/SN3:
  dragster, max accel=mu g unless Fn>mg
  typically Fn up to 5 mg for dragsters and formula 1 cars

cool example for CL3/SN2:
  cyclists compute "inches" = diam of wheel * diam of front chain ring / diam of back chain ring
  interpreted as distance traveled per cycle of pedals, divided by pi

problem with proof of elliptical orbit law
  see  physics/classical_mechanics
-----------------------------------

discussion of general relativity:
  nice place to start is causality => no instantaneous action at a distance
      => N's law of gravity wrong
  nice example: precession of mercury as a less extreme example of falling into
      a black hole: time dwelling near perihelion becomes longer
  diagrams of tilted light cones
  see relativity notes in meki
  smolin has interesting philosophical intro in 3 roads:
    - different observers can see different things => nonaristotelian logic
             (cf. Susskind's book, which I took detailed notes on and then gave to Alex;
             story of A being dropped into black hole and being annihilated by Hawking
             radiation according to B, whereas A feels nothing wrong)
    - it's a "relational" theory, i.e., nothing is meaningful about the field lines except for
             their relations to each other

particle physics
  possible broad outline: make table of (classical,special rel,general rel)x(classical,qm)
  gauge symmetry
    This is a nice place to start, actually. The wp article as of this date
      http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nontechnical_introduction_to_gauge_theory&oldid=307810361
    is basically all my own writing. (I jumped into it during a long, low-intensity edit war between other
    people. It may end up succumbing to the forces of chaos in the future.) Also see my meki E&M notes under gauge.
    I'm proud that I was able to explain it so well without math, up to and including cons of charge, and gauge bosons and the necessity for
    something like an EM interaction between particles.
    It's also a nice lead-in to the high-energy stuff.
  Gauge stuff (& gauge bosons) leads naturally into QED a la Feynman, also into particle zoo stuff.
  Infinities, renormalization => motiv for string theory, or granularity at planck scale...?
  also, see my lec for last day of 223
  qed, a la Feynman; depiction of interactions as exchanges of particles; infinities
  we'd like to unify the forces; unification of EM with weak
  strong force
    quark model (evidence: particle zoo); fractional charges
    gravity has 1 flavor of charge, e&m 2, strong 3; rules for strong are red repels red, red attracts blue, etc.
    Cavendish and Coulomb measured force laws by setting spherical balls at distance r
    uncharged objects can also participate in electrical forces, e.g., H2 molecule is bound;
             can try to mock up interactions using some formula, e.g., van der Waals, but it's
             going to be approximate and messy; interactions between neutral objects fall off
             faster than 1/r2 for geometrical reasons
    searches for isolated quarks (e.g., search for fractional charges in Millikan-style expt) have
             failed; current interp is that the quark-quark interaction gets *stronger* with
             distance, so free quarks can't exist; therefore we're restricted to measuring
             forces between composite objects; as with Coulomb force, the forces between neutral
             objects fall off quickly with distance compared to what you'd expect from the
             underlying force between the fundamental particles; since all you get access to
             is the messy, ugly behavior of the composite force, it's difficult to get any
             clear information about the underlying (presumably simple) force law for the
             fundamental particles
  quantum gravity; when you need it: planck scale, big bang;
             infinities in qed only went away with a lot of luck; when you try to apply
             it to gravity, they don't want to go away; people thought at first that this was
             a purely technical issue, but now we know that there are fundamental reasons, because
             you can't treat spacetime as a static background; model-independent arguments a la Smolen for
             granularity of spacetime
