In July of 1994, Comet Shoemaker-Levy struck the
planet Jupiter, depositing $7\times10^{22}$ joules of energy, and
incidentally giving rise to a series of Hollywood movies
in which our own planet is threatened by an
impact by a comet or asteroid. There is evidence that
such an impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.
Left: Jupiter's gravitational force on the near side of
the comet was greater than on the far side, and this
difference in force tore up the comet into a string of
fragments. Two separate telescope images have been
combined to create the illusion of a point of view just
behind the comet. (The colored fringes at the edges
of Jupiter are artifacts of the imaging system.) Top: A
series of images of the plume of superheated gas
kicked up by the impact of one of the fragments. The
plume is about the size of North America. Bottom: An
image after all the impacts were over, showing the
damage done.},

\begin{vocab}

\vocabitem{energy}{A numerical scale used to measure the heat, motion,
or other properties that would require fuel or physical
effort to put into an object; a scalar quantity with
units of joules (J).}

\vocabitem{power}{The rate of transferring energy; a scalar quantity
with units of watts (W).}

\vocabitem{kinetic energy}{The energy an object possesses because of its motion.}

\vocabitem{heat}{A form of energy that relates to temperature.
Heat is different from temperature because an object with
twice as much mass requires twice as much heat to increase
its temperature by the same amount. Heat is measured in joules, temperature
in degrees. (In standard terminology, there
is another, finer distinction between heat and thermal energy,
which is discussed below. In this book, I informally refer to both
as heat.)
}

\vocabitem{temperature}{What a thermometer measures. Objects left in
contact with each other tend to reach the same temperature.
Cf. heat. As discussed in more detail in chapter 2,
temperature is essentially a measure of the average kinetic
energy per molecule.}

\notationitem{$E$}{energy}

\notationitem{J}{joules, the SI unit of energy}

\notationitem{$KE$}{kinetic energy}

\notationitem{$P$}{power}

\notationitem{W}{watts, the SI unit of power; equivalent to J/s}

\begin{othernotation}

\notationitem{$Q$ or $\Delta Q$}{the amount of heat transferred into or out of an object}

\notationitem{$K$ or $T$}{alternative symbols for kinetic energy, used in the
scientific literature and in most advanced textbooks}

\vocabitem{thermal energy}{Careful writers make a distinction between
heat and thermal energy, but the distinction is often
ignored in casual speech, even among physicists. Properly,
thermal energy is used to mean the total amount of energy
possessed by an object, while heat indicates the amount of
thermal energy transferred in or out. The term heat is used
in this book to include both meanings.}

\begin{summarytext}

Heating an object, making it move faster, or increasing its
distance from another object that is attracting it are all
examples of things that would require fuel or physical
effort. All these things can be
quantified using a single scale of measurement, and we describe them all as forms of \emph{energy}. 
The SI unit of
energy is the Joule. The reason why energy is a useful and
important quantity is that it is always conserved. That is,
it cannot be created or destroyed but only transferred
between objects or changed from one form to another.
Conservation of energy is the most important and broadly
applicable of all the laws of physics, more fundamental and
general even than Newton's laws of motion.

Heating an object requires a certain amount of energy per
degree of temperature and per unit mass, which depends on
the substance of which the object consists. Heat and
temperature are completely different things. Heat is a form
of energy, and its SI unit is the joule (J). Temperature is
not a measure of energy. Heating twice as much of something
requires twice as much heat, but double the amount of a
substance does not have double the temperature.

The energy that an object possesses because of its motion is
called kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is related to the mass
of the object and the magnitude of its velocity vector by the equation
\begin{equation*}
  KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

Power is the rate at which energy is transformed from one
form to another or transferred from one object to another,
\begin{equation*}
m4_ifelse(__me,1,[:%
  P = \frac{\der E}{\der t}
:],[:%
 P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}\eqquad. 
        \qquad\hfill\shoveright{\text{[only for constant power]}}
:])%
\end{equation*}
The SI unit of power is the watt (W).
