\begin{summarytext}

A large class of optical devices, including lenses and flat
and curved mirrors, operates by bending light rays to form
an image. A real image is one for which the rays actually
cross at each point of the image. A virtual image, such as
the one formed behind a flat mirror, is one for which the
rays only appear to have crossed at a point on the image. A
real image can be projected onto a screen; a virtual one cannot.

Mirrors and lenses will generally make an image that is
either smaller than or larger than the original object. The
scaling factor is called the magnification. In many
situations, the angular magnification is more important than
the actual magnification.

In this chapter we've only done examples of mirrors with
hollowed-out shapes (called concave mirrors). Now draw a ray
diagram for a curved mirror that has a bulging outward shape
(called a convex mirror). (a) How does the image's distance
from the mirror compare with the actual object's distance
from the mirror? From this comparison, determine whether the
magnification is greater than or less than one. (b) Is the
image real, or virtual? Could this mirror ever make the
other type of image?

\noindent Equipment:

\begin{indentedblock}
	concave mirrors with deep curvature

	concave mirrors with gentle curvature

	convex mirrors
\end{indentedblock}

1. Obtain a curved mirror from your instructor. If it is
silvered on both sides, make sure you're working with the
concave side, which bends light rays inward. Look at
your own face in the mirror. Now change the distance between
your face and the mirror, and see what happens. Explore the full range
of possible distances between your face and the mirror.

In these observations you've been changing two variables at once:
the distance between the object (your face) and the mirror, and the
distance from the mirror to your eye. In general, scientific experiments
become easier to interpret if we practice isolation of variables,
i.e., only change one variable while keeping all the others constant.
In parts 2 and 3 you'll form an image of an object that's not your face,
so that you can have independent control of the object distance and
the point of view.

2. With the mirror held far away from you, observe the image
of something behind you, over your shoulder. Now bring your
eye closer and closer to the mirror. Can you see the image
with your eye very close to the mirror? See if you can explain your
observation by drawing a ray diagram.

3. Now imagine the following new situation, but \emph{don't
actually do it yet}. Suppose you lay the mirror face-up on a
piece of tissue paper, put your finger a few cm above the
mirror, and look at the image of your finger. As in part 2,
you can bring your eye closer and closer to the mirror.

Will you be
able to see the image with your eye very close to the mirror?
Draw a ray diagram to help you predict what you will observe.

Prediction:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now test your prediction. If your prediction was incorrect,
see if you can figure out what went wrong, or ask your instructor for help.

4. For parts 4 and 5, it's more convenient to use concave mirrors that are
more gently curved; obtain one from your instructor.
Lay the mirror on the tissue paper, and use it to create
an image of the overhead lights on a piece of paper above it
and a little off to the side. What do you have to do in
order to make the image clear? Can you explain this observation using a ray diagram?

5. Now imagine the following experiment, but \emph{don't do
it yet}. What will happen to the image on the paper if you
cover half of the mirror with your hand?

Prediction:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Test your prediction. If your prediction was incorrect, can
you explain what happened?

6. Now imagine forming an image with a convex mirror (one that
bulges outward), and that therefore bends light rays away
from the central axis (i.e., is diverging). Draw a typical ray diagram.

\vspace{90mm}

Is the
image real, or virtual? Will there be more than one type of image?

Test your prediction.
