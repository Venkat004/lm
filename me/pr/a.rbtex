There is unfortunately another reason why this
spacecraft is relevant to the topics of this chapter: it
was destroyed attempting to enter Mars' atmosphere
because engineers at Lockheed Martin forgot to
convert data on engine thrusts from pounds into the

information to NASA. Conversions are important!},

Physics is the use of the scientific method to study the
behavior of light and matter. The scientific method requires
a cycle of theory and experiment, theories with both
predictive and explanatory value, and reproducible experiments.

The metric system is a simple, consistent framework for
measurement built out of the meter, the kilogram, and the
second plus a set of prefixes denoting powers of ten. The
most systematic method for doing conversions is shown in
the following example:
\begin{equation*}
  370\ \zu{ms} \times \frac{10^{-3}\ \sunit}{1\ \zu{ms}} = 0.37\ \sunit
\end{equation*}

Mass is a measure of the amount of a substance. Mass can be
defined gravitationally, by comparing an object to a
standard mass on a double-pan balance, or in terms of
inertia, by comparing the effect of a force on an object to
the effect of the same force on a standard mass. The two
definitions are found experimentally to be proportional to
each other to a high degree of precision, so we usually
refer simply to ``mass,'' without bothering to specify which type.

A force is that which can change the motion of an object.
The metric unit of force is the Newton, defined as the force
required to accelerate a standard 1-kg mass from rest to a
speed of 1 m/s in 1 s.

Scientific notation means, for example, writing $3.2\times10^5$
 rather than 320000.

Writing numbers with the correct number of significant
figures correctly communicates how accurate they are. As a
rule of thumb, the final result of a calculation is no more
accurate than, and should have no more significant figures
than, the least accurate piece of data.

The motion of falling objects has been recognized since
ancient times as an important piece of physics, but the
motion is inconveniently fast, so in our everyday experience
it can be hard to tell exactly what objects are doing when
they fall. In this exercise you will use several techniques
to get around this problem and study the motion. Your goal
is to construct a scientific \emph{model} of falling. A
model means an explanation that makes testable predictions.
Often models contain simplifications or idealizations that
make them easier to work with, even though they are
not strictly realistic.

1. One method of making falling easier to observe is to use
objects like feathers that we know from everyday experience
will not fall as fast. You will use coffee filters, in
stacks of various sizes, to test the following two
hypotheses and see which one is true, or whether neither is true:

Hypothesis 1A: When an object is dropped, it rapidly speeds
up to a certain natural falling speed, and then continues to
fall at that speed. The falling speed is \emph{proportional}
to the object's weight. (A proportionality is not just a
statement that if one thing gets bigger, the other does too.
It says that if one becomes three times bigger, the other
also gets three times bigger, etc.)

Hypothesis 1B: Different objects fall the same way,
regardless of weight.

Test these hypotheses and discuss your results with your instructor.

2. A second way to slow down the action is to let a ball
roll down a ramp. The steeper the ramp, the closer to free
fall. Based on your experience in part 1, write a hypothesis
about what will happen when you race a heavier ball against
a lighter ball down the same ramp, starting them both from rest.

Hypothesis:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Show your hypothesis to your instructor, and then test it.

You have probably found that falling was more complicated
than you thought! Is there more than one factor that affects
the motion of a falling object? Can you imagine certain
idealized situations that are simpler? Try to agree verbally
with your group on an informal model of falling that can
make predictions about the experiments described in parts 3 and 4.

3. You have three balls: a standard ``comparison ball'' of
medium weight, a light ball, and a heavy ball. Suppose you
stand on a chair and (a) drop the light ball side by side
with the comparison ball, then (b) drop the heavy ball side
by side with the comparison ball, then (c) join the light
and heavy balls together with sticky tape and drop them side
by side with the comparison ball.

Use your model to make a prediction:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Test your prediction.

4. Your instructor will pump nearly all the air out of a
chamber containing a feather and a heavier object, then let
them fall side by side in the chamber.
