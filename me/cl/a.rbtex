In July of 1994, Comet Shoemaker-Levy struck the
planet Jupiter, depositing $7\times10^{22}$ joules of energy, and
incidentally giving rise to a series of Hollywood movies
in which our own planet is threatened by an
impact by a comet or asteroid. There is evidence that
such an impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.

<% begin_sec("Failure of Newton's laws") %>
One of the main reasons for preferring conservation laws to Newton's laws as
a foundation for physics is that conservation laws are more general.
For example, Newton's laws apply only to matter, whereas conservation
laws can handle light as well. No experiment in Newton's day had ever
shown anything but zero for the mass or weight of a ray of light,
and substituting $m=0$ into $a=F/m$ results in an infinite acceleration,
which doesn't make sense.
With hindsight, this is to be expected because of 
relativity (section \ref{sec:relativity}). Newton's laws are only a good approximation
for velocities that are small compared to $c$, the maximum speed of
cause and effect. But light travels at $c$, so Newton's laws are
not a good approximation to the behavior of light.

For insight into the behavior of things that go at exactly $c$, let's
consider a case where something goes very close to $c$.
A typical 22-caliber rifle shoots a bullet with a mass of about 3 g at a speed of about 400 m/s.
Now consider the firing of such a rifle as seen through an ultra-powerful telescope
by an alien in a distant galaxy. We happen to be firing in the direction away from the
alien, who gets a view from over our shoulder. Since the universe is expanding, our two galaxies
are receding from each other. In the alien's frame, our own galaxy is the one that is
moving --- let's say at $c-(200\ \munit/\sunit)$. If the two velocities simply added, the
bullet would be moving at $c+(200\ \munit/\sunit)$. But velocities don't simply add and
subtract relativistically (p.~\pageref{me-vel-addition-main-text}), and applying the correct
equation for relativistic combination of velocities, we find that in the alien's frame,
the bullet flies at only $c-(199.9995\ \munit/\sunit)$. That is, according to the alien,
the energy in the gunpowder only succeeded in accelerating the bullet by $0.0005\ \munit/\sunit$!
If we insisted on believing in $KE=(1/2)mv^2$, this would clearly violate conservation of energy in the alien's frame of reference.
$KE$ must not only get bigger faster than $(1/2)mv^2$ as $v$ approaches $c$, it must blow up to infinity.
This gives a mechanical explanation for why no material object can
ever reach or exceed $c$, which is reassuring because speeds greater than $c$ lead to violation of causality.

<% begin_sec("Ultrarelativistic motion") %>
The bullet as seen in the alien's frame of reference is an example of an ultrarelativistic
particle, meaning one moving very close to $c$. We can fairly easily infer quite a bit about how kinetic
energy must behave at ultrarelativistic speeds. We know that it must get larger and larger,
and the question is how large it is when the speed differs from $c$ by some small amount.

A good way of thinking about an ultrarelativistic particle is that it's a particle with a
very small mass. For example, the subatomic particle called the neutrino has a very small
mass, thousands of times smaller than that of the electron. Neutrinos are emitted in
radioactive decay, and because the neutrino's mass is so small, the amount of energy
available in these decays is always enough to accelerate it to very close to the speed
of light. Nobody has ever succeeded in observing a neutrino that was \emph{not} ultrarelativistic.
When a particle's mass is very small, the mass becomes difficult to measure. For almost 70 years after the
neutrino was discovered, its mass was thought to be zero. Similarly, we currently believe that
a ray of light has no mass, but it is always possible that its mass will be found to be nonzero
at some point in the future. A ray of light can be modeled as an ultrarelativistic particle.

Let's compare ultrarelativistic particles with train cars. A single car with kinetic energy $E$ has
different properties than a train of two cars each with kinetic energy $E/2$. The single car has
half the mass and a speed that is greater by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. But the same is not true
for ultrarelativistic particles. Since an idealized ultrarelativistic particle has a mass too
small to be detectable in any experiment, we can't detect the difference between $m$ and $2m$.
Furthermore, ultrarelativistic particles move at close to $c$, so there is no observable
difference in speed. Thus we expect that a single ultrarelativistic particle with energy $E$
compared with  two such particles, each with energy $E/2$,
should have all the same properties as measured by a mechanical detector.

An idealized zero-mass particle also has no frame in which it can be at rest. It
always travels at $c$, and no matter how fast we chase after it, we can never catch up.
We can, however, observe it in different frames of reference, and we will find that its
energy is different. For example, distant galaxies are receding from us at substantial fractions
of $c$, and when we observe them through a telescope, they appear very dim not just because they are very
far away but also because their light has less energy in our frame than in a frame at rest
relative to the source. This effect must be such that changing frames of reference according
to a specific Lorentz transformation always changes the energy of the particle by a fixed factor,
regardless of the particle's original energy;
for if not, then the effect of a Lorentz transformation on a single particle of energy $E$
would be different from its effect on two particles of energy $E/2$.

How does this energy-shift factor depend on the velocity $v$ of the Lorentz transformation?
Actually, it is more convenient to express this in terms of a different variable rather than
$v$. In nonrelativistic
physics, we change frames of reference simply by adding a constant onto all our velocities,
but this is only a low-velocity approximation. For this reason, it will be more convenient to
work with a variable $s$, defined as the factor by which the long diagonal of a
parallelogram like the ones in section \ref{sec:relativity} stretches under a Lorentz transformation.
For example, we found in problem \ref{hw:six-tenths-c-twice} on p.~\pageref{hw:six-tenths-c-twice}
that a velocity of $0.6c$ corresponds to a stretch factor $s=2$. The convenient thing about
stretch factors is that when we change to a new frame of reference, they simply multiply.
For example, in problem \ref{hw:six-tenths-c-twice} you found the result of combining
a velocity of $0.6c$ with another velocity of $0.6c$ by drawing a parallelogram with
its long axis stretched by a factor of $2\times2=4$.
The relation between
$s$ and $v$ is given by $s=\sqrt{(1+v)/(1-v)}$ (in units with $c=1$; see problems \ref{hw:gamma-derivation} on p.~\pageref{hw:gamma-derivation}
and \ref{hw:me-vel-addition} on p.~\pageref{hw:me-vel-addition}).

\begin{eg}{A low-speed approximation}\label{eg:low-speed-stretch}
What happens when the  the velocity is small compared
to $c$? In units where $c=1$, this means that $v$ is small compared
to 1. The stretch factor $s=\sqrt{(1+v)/(1-v)}$ can then be approximated
by taking $1/(1-v)\approx 1+v$ and $\sqrt{1+\epsilon}\approx 1+\epsilon/2$,\
so that $s\approx 1+v$.
\end{eg}

Let's write $f(s)$ for the energy-shift factor that results from a given Lorentz transformation.
Since a Lorentz transformation $s_1$ followed by a second transformation $s_2$ is equivalent
to a single transformation by $s_1s_2$, we must have $f(s_1s_2)=f(s_1)f(s_2)$. This tightly
constrains the form of the function $f$; it must be something like $f(s)=s^n$, where $n$
is a constant. The interpretation of $n$ is that under a Lorentz transformation corresponding to 1\%
of $c$, energies of ultrarelativistic particles change by about $n$\% (making the approximation that $v=.01$ gives $s\approx1.01$).
We postpone until p.~\pageref{pesky-exponent-proof} the proof that $n=1$, which is also in agreement with experiments with rays of light.\label{pesky-exponent-claim}

Our final result is that the energy of an ultrarelativistic particle is simply proportional
to its Lorentz ``stretch factor'' $s$. Even in the case where the particle is truly massless,
so that $s$ doesn't have any finite value, we can still
find how the energy differs according to different observers by finding the $s$ of the
Lorentz transformation between the two observers' frames of reference.

\begin{eg}{An astronomical energy shift}
\egquestion For quantum-mechanical
reasons, a hydrogen atom can only exist in states with certain specific energies.
By conservation of energy, the atom can therefore only absorb or emit light that
has an energy equal to the difference between two such atomic energies.
The outer atmosphere of a star is mostly made of monoatomic hydrogen, and
one of the energies that a hydrogen atom can absorb or emit is
$3.0276\times10^{-19}\ \junit$. When we observe light from stars in the Andromeda
Galaxy, it has an energy of $3.0306\times10^{-19}\ \junit$. If this is assumed to be
due entirely to the motion of the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy relative to
one another, along the line connecting them,
find the direction and magnitude of this velocity.

\eganswer The energy is shifted upward, which means that the Andromeda Galaxy is moving
toward us. (Galaxies at cosmological distances are always observed to be receding from
one another, but this doesn't necessarily hold for galaxies as close as these.)
Relating the energy shift to the velocity, we have
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{E'}{E} = s = \sqrt{(1+v)/(1-v)}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Since the shift is only about one part per thousand, the velocity is small compared
to $c$ --- or small compared to 1 in units where $c=1$. Therefore we can approximate
as in example \ref{eg:low-speed-stretch}, $s\approx 1+v$, and we find
\begin{equation*}
  v \approx s-1 = \frac{E'}{E}-1 = 1.0\times10^{-3}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
This is in units where $c=1$. Converting to SI units, where $c\ne 1$, we have $v=(1.0\times10^{-3})c=300\ \zu{km}/s$.
Although the Andromeda Galaxy's tangential motion is not accurately known, it is considered likely that it will
collide with the Milky Way in a few billion years.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{A symmetry property of the energy shift}\label{eg:doppler-abc}
Suppose that A and B are at rest relative to one another, but C is moving along the line between A and B. A sends a pulse of laser light
to C, who then measures its energy and transmits another pulse to B having the same energy.
The pulse accumulates two energy shifts, and the result is their product $s(v)s(-v)$. But C didn't actually need to absorb the
original pulse and retransmit it; the results would have been the same if C had just stayed out of the way.
Therefore this product must equal 1, so we must have $s(-v)s(v)=1$, which can be verified directly from the equation.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{The Ives-Stilwell experiment}\index{Ives-Stilwell experiment}
The result of example \ref{eg:doppler-abc} was the basis of one of the earliest laboratory tests of special relativity, by Ives and Stilwell in 1938.
They observed the light emitted by a beam of excited $\zu{H}_2^+$ and $\zu{H}_3^+$ ions with speeds of a few tenths of a percent of $c$.
Measuring the light from both ahead of and behind the beams, they found that the product $s(v)s(-v)$ was equal to 1,
as predicted by relativity. If relativity had been false, then one would have expected the product to differ from 1 by an amount that would
have been detectable in their experiment. In 2003, Saathoff et al.~carried out an extremely precise version of the Ives-Stilwell technique
with $\zu{Li}^+$ ions moving at 6.4\% of $c$. The energies observed, in units of $10^{-28}\ \junit$, were:

\noindent\begin{tabular}{rl}
$E_\zu{o}$ &=               $3620927488 \pm 3$ \\
           & \hfill (unshifted energy)\\
$E_\zu{o}s(v)$ & =          $3859620256 \pm 0.6$ \\
           & \hfill (shifted energy, forward)\\
$E_\zu{o} s(-v)$ & =        $3396996334 \pm 3$ \\
           & \hfill (shifted energy, backward)\\
$\sqrt{E_\zu{o}s(v)\cdot E_\zu{o} s(-v)}$ &= $3620927487 \pm 2$ 
\end{tabular}

\noindent The results show incredibly precise agreement between $E_\zu{o}$ and $\sqrt{E_\zu{o}s(v)\cdot E_\zu{o} s(-v)}$, as expected
relativistically because $s(v)s(-v)$ is supposed to equal 1. The agreement extends to 9 significant figures, whereas
if relativity had been false there should have been a relative disagreement of about $v^2=.004$, i.e., a discrepancy in the third significant figure.
The spectacular agreement with theory has made this experiment a lightning rod for
anti-relativity kooks.

\begin{summarytext}

Heating an object, making it move faster, or increasing its
distance from another object that is attracting it are all
examples of things that would require fuel or physical
effort. All these things can be
quantified using a single scale of measurement, and we describe them all as forms of \emph{energy}. 
The SI unit of
energy is the Joule. The reason why energy is a useful and
important quantity is that it is always conserved. That is,
it cannot be created or destroyed but only transferred
between objects or changed from one form to another.
Conservation of energy is the most important and broadly
applicable of all the laws of physics, more fundamental and
general even than Newton's laws of motion.

Heating an object requires a certain amount of energy per
degree of temperature and per unit mass, which depends on
the substance of which the object consists. Heat and
temperature are completely different things. Heat is a form
of energy, and its SI unit is the joule (J). Temperature is
not a measure of energy. Heating twice as much of something
requires twice as much heat, but double the amount of a
substance does not have double the temperature.

The energy that an object possesses because of its motion is
called kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is related to the mass
of the object and the magnitude of its velocity vector by the equation
\begin{equation*}
  KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

Power is the rate at which energy is transformed from one
form to another or transferred from one object to another,
\begin{equation*}
m4_ifelse(__me,1,[:%
  P = \frac{\der E}{\der t}
:],[:%
 P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}\eqquad. 
        \qquad\hfill\shoveright{\text{[only for constant power]}}
:])%
\end{equation*}
The SI unit of power is the watt (W).

The equation $KE=(1/2)mv^2$ is a nonrelativistic approximation, valid at speeds that are small
compared to $c$. In the opposite limit, of a particle with a speed very
close to $c$, the energy is proportional
to the ``stretch factor'' of the Lorentz transformation, $s=\sqrt{(1+v)/(1-v)}$ (in units with $c=1$),
for $v\rightarrow+c$ and $1/s$ for $v\rightarrow-c$.
This gives a mechanical explanation for why no material object can
ever reach or exceed $c$, which is reassuring because speeds greater than $c$ lead to violation of causality.

All stars, including our sun, show variations in their
light output to some degree. Some stars vary their
brightness by a factor of two or even more, but our sun has
remained relatively steady during the hundred years or so
that accurate data have been collected. Nevertheless, it is
possible that climate variations such as ice ages are
related to long-term irregularities in the sun's light
output. If the sun was to increase its light output even
slightly, it could melt enough Antarctic ice to
flood all the world's coastal cities. The total sunlight
that falls on Antarctica amounts to about $1\times10^{16}$
 watts. Presently, this heat input to the poles is balanced
by the loss of heat via winds, ocean currents, and emission
of infrared light, so that there is no net melting or
freezing of ice at the poles from year to year. Suppose that
the sun changes its light output by some small percentage,
but there is no change in the rate of heat loss by the polar
caps. Estimate the percentage by which the sun's light
output would have to increase in order to melt enough ice to
raise the level of the oceans by 10 meters over a period of
10 years. (This would be enough to flood New York, London,
and many other cities.) Melting 1 kg of ice requires $3\times10^3$ J.
