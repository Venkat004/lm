<% begin_sec("A dot product for relativity?",nil,'',{'optional'=>true}) %>
In section \ref{sec:dot-product-uniquness} I showed that the dot product is the only physically sensible way to multiply two vectors
to get a scalar. This is essentially because the outcome of experiments shouldn't depend on which way we rotate the laboratory.
Dot products relate to the lengths of vectors and the angles between them, and rotations don't change lengths or angles.

Let's consider how this would apply to relativity. Relativity tells us that the length of a measuring rod is \emph{not} absolute.
Rotating the lab won't change its length, but changing the lab's state of motion will. The rod's length is greatest in the frame
that is at rest relative to the rod. This suggests that relativity requires some new variation on the dot product: some slightly different way
of multiplying two vectors to find a number that doesn't depend on the frame of reference.

<% begin_sec("Clock time") %>
We do know of a number that stays the same in all frames of reference.
In figure \figref{area-proof} on p.~\pageref{fig:area-proof}, we proved that the Lorentz transformation doesn't change the area of a shape in the $x$-$t$ plane.
We used this only as a stepping stone toward the Lorentz transformation, but it is natural to wonder whether
this kind of area has any physical interest of its own.

The equal-area result is not relativistic, since the proof never appeals to property 5 on page \pageref{spacetime-properties}. Cases
I and II on page \pageref{fig:three-cases} also have the equal-area property. We can see this clearly in a Galilean transformation like
figure \figref{galilean-boost} on p.~\pageref{fig:galilean-boost}, where the distortion of the rectangle could be accomplished by cutting it into
vertical slices and then displacing the slices upward without changing their areas.

But the area does have a nice interpretation in the relativistic
case. Suppose that we have events A (Charles VII is restored to the throne) and B (Joan of Arc is executed). Now imagine
that technologically advanced aliens want to be present at both A and B, but in the interim they wish to fly away in their spaceship, be present
at some other event P (perhaps a news conference at which they give an update on the events taking place on earth), but get back in
time for B. Since nothing can go faster than $c$ (which we take to equal 1 in appropriate units), P cannot be too far away. The set of all possible events
P forms a rectangle, figure \subfigref{light-rectangles}{1}, in the $x-t$ plane that has A and B at opposite corners and whose edges have slopes equal to $\pm 1$.
We call this type of rectangle a light-rectangle, because its sides could represent the motion of rays of light.

    %q{1.~The gray light-rectangle represents the set of all events such as P that could be visited after A and before B.\\\\
       2.~The rectangle becomes a square in the frame in which A and B occur at the same location in space.\\\\
       3.~The area of the dashed square is $\tau^2$, so the area of the gray square is $\tau^2/2$.},

The area of this rectangle will be the same regardless of one's frame of reference. In particular, we could choose a
special frame of reference, panel 2 of the figure, such that A and B occur
in the same place. (They do not occur at the same place, for example, in the sun's frame,
because the earth is spinning and going around the sun.) Since the speed $c$, which equals 1 in our units,
is the same in all frames of reference, and the sides of
the rectangle had slopes $\pm 1$ in frame 1, they must still have slopes $\pm 1$ in frame 2.
The rectangle becomes a square with its diagonals parallel to the $x$ and $t$ axes, and the length of these diagonals equals the
time $\tau$ elapsed on a clock that is at rest in frame 2, i.e., a clock that glides through space at constant velocity from A to B,
meeting up with the planet earth at the appointed time.
As shown in panel 3 of the figure, the area of the gray regions can be interpreted as half the square of this gliding-clock time.

If events A and B are separated by a distance $x$ and a time $t$, then in general $t^2-x^2$ gives the square of the gliding-clock time. Proof: Based
on units, the expression must have the form $(\ldots)t^2+(\ldots)tx+(\ldots)x^2$, where each $(\ldots)$ represents a unitless constant.
The $tx$ coefficient must be zero by property 2 on p.~\pageref{spacetime-properties}. For consistency with figure \subfigref{light-rectangles}{3},
the $t^2$ coefficient must equal 1. Since the area vanishes for $x=t$, the $x^2$ coefficient must equal $-1$.

When $|x|$ is greater than $|t|$, events A and B are so far apart in space and so close together in time that
it would be impossible to have a cause and effect relationship between them, since $c=1$ is the maximum speed of cause and effect.
In this situation $t^2-x^2$ is negative and cannot be interpreted as a clock time, but it can be interpreted as minus the square of the
distance between A and B as measured by rulers at rest in a frame in which A and B are simultaneous.

<% begin_sec("Four-vectors") %>\label{sec:four-vectors}
No matter what, $t^2-x^2$ is the same as measured in all frames of reference. Geometrically, it plays the same role
in the $x$-$t$ plane that ruler measurements play in the Euclidean plane. In Euclidean
geometry, the ruler-distance between any two points stays the same regardless of rotation, i.e., regardless of 
the angle from which we view the scene; according to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of this distance is $x^2+y^2$.
In the $x$-$t$ plane, $t^2-x^2$ stays the same regardless of the
frame of reference. This suggests that by analogy with the dot product
\begin{equation*}
  x_1x_2+y_1y_2
\end{equation*}
in the Euclidean $x$-$y$ plane, we define a similar operation in the $x$-$t$ plane,
\begin{equation*}
  t_1t_2-x_1x_2\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Putting in the other two spatial dimensions, we have
\begin{equation*}
  t_1t_2-x_1x_2-y_1y_2-z_1z_2\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
A mathematical object like $(t,x,y,z)$ is referred to as a four-vector,\index{four-vector}\index{vector!four-vector}
as opposed to a three-vector like $(x,y,z)$. The term ``dot product'' has connotations of referring only to
three-vectors, so the operation of taking the scalar product of two four-vectors is usually referred to
instead as the ``inner product.'' There are various ways of notating the inner product of vectors
$\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$, such as $\vc{a}\cdot\vc{b}$ or $<\vc{a},\vc{b}>$.

The magnitude of a three-vector is defined by taking the square root of its dot product with itself,
and this square root is always a real number, because a vector's dot product with itself is always positive.
But the inner product of a four-vector with itself can be positive, zero, or
negative, and in these cases the vector is referred to as timelike, lightlike, spacelike, respectively.
Since material objects can never go as fast as $c$, the vector $(\Delta t,\Delta x,\Delta y,\Delta z)$
describing an object's motion from one event to another is always timelike.

\begin{eg}{The twin paradox}\index{triangle inequality}\index{twin paradox}
One of the classic paradoxes of relativity, known as the twin paradox, is usually stated something like this.
Alice and Betty are identical twins. Betty goes on a space voyage at relativistic speeds, traveling away from the
earth and then turning around and coming back. Meanwhile, Alice stays on earth. When Betty returns, she is younger
than Alice because of relativistic time dilation. But isn't it valid to say that Betty's spaceship is standing still
and the earth moving? In that description, wouldn't Alice end up younger and Betty older?

The most common way of explaining the non-paradoxical nature of this paradox is that although special relativity
says that inertial motion is relative, it doesn't say that noninertial motion is relative. In this respect it
is the same as Newtonian mechanics. Betty experiences accelerations on her voyage, but Alice doesn't. Therefore
there is no doubt about who actually went on the trip and who didn't.

This resolution, however, may not be entirely satisfying because it makes it sound as if relativistic time
dilation is not occurring while Betty's ship cruises at constant velocity, but only while the ship is speeding
up or slowing down. This would appear to contradict our earlier interpretation of relativistic time dilation,
which was that a clock runs fastest according to an observer at rest relative to the clock. Furthermore, if
it's acceleration that causes the effect, should we be looking for some new formula that computes time
dilation based on acceleration?

The first thing to realize is that there is no unambiguous way to decide during which part of Betty's journey
the time dilation is occurring. To do this, we could need to be able to compare Alice and Betty's clocks
many times over the course of the trip. But neither twin has any way of finding out what her sister's clock reads
``now,'' except by exchanging radio signals, which travel at the speed of light. The speed-of-light lag vanishes
only at the beginning and end of the trip, when the twins are in the same place.

Furthermore, we can use the inner product to show that the accumulated difference in clock time doesn't depend
on the details of how Betty carries out her accelerations and decelerations. In fact, we can get the right
answer simply by assuming that these changes in velocities occur instantaneously.

In Euclidean geometry, the triangle inequality $|\vc{b}+\vc{c}|<|\vc{b}|+|\vc{c}|$ follows from
\begin{equation*}
 (|\vc{b}|+|\vc{c}|)^2-(\vc{b}+\vc{c})\cdot(\vc{b}+\vc{c})=2(|\vc{b}||\vc{c}|-\vc{b}\cdot\vc{c}) \ge 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The reason this quantity always comes out positive is that for two vectors of fixed magnitude, the
greatest dot product is always achieved in the case where they lie along the same direction.

In the geometry of the $x$-$t$ plane, the situation is different. Suppose that $\vc{b}$ and $\vc{c}$ are timelike vectors, so that
they represent possible
$(\Delta t,\Delta x,\ldots)$ vectors for Betty on the outward and return legs of her trip. Then $\vc{a}=\vc{b}+\vc{c}$
describes the vector for Alice's motion. Alice goes by a direct route through the $x$-$t$ plane while Betty takes
a detour. The magnitude of each timelike vector represents the time elapsed on a clock carried by that twin.
The triangle equality is now reversed, becoming $|\vc{b}+\vc{c}|>|\vc{b}|+|\vc{c}|$.
The difference from the Euclidean case arises because inner products are no longer necessarily maximized if vectors
are in the same direction.
E.g., for two lightlike vectors, $\vc{b}\cdot\vc{c}$ vanishes entirely if $\vc{b}$ and $\vc{c}$
are parallel.
For timelike vectors, parallelism actually minimizes the inner product rather 
than maximizing it.\footnote{Proof: Let $\vc{b}$ and $\vc{c}$ be parallel and timelike, and directed
forward in time. Adopt a frame of reference in which
every spatial component of each vector vanishes.
This entails no loss of generality, since inner products are
invariant under such a transformation.
Now let  $\vc{b}$ and $\vc{c}$ be pulled away
from parallelism, like opening a pair of scissors in the $x-t$ plane. This reduces $b_tc_t$, while causing
$b_xc_x$ to become negative. Both effects increase the inner product.}
