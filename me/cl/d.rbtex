How does momentum behave in relativity?

Newtonian mechanics has two different measures of motion, kinetic energy and momentum,
and the relationship between them is nonlinear. Doubling your car's momentum quadruples
its kinetic energy.

But nonrelativistic mechanics can't handle massless particles, which are always ultrarelativistic.
We saw in section \ref{sec:ultrarelativistic} that ultrarelativistic particles are ``generic,''
in the sense that they have no individual mechanical properties other than an energy and a direction
of motion. Therefore the relationship between kinetic energy and momentum must be \emph{linear}
for ultrarelativistic particles. Indeed, experiments verify that light has momentum, and
doubling the energy of a ray of light doubles its momentum rather than quadrupling it.

How can we make sense of these energy-momentum relationships, which seem to take on two completely
different forms in the limiting cases of very low and very high velocities?

The first step is realize that since mass and energy are equivalent (section \ref{sec:mass-energy-equivalence}),
we will get more of an apples-to-apples comparison if we stop talking about a material object's
\emph{kinetic} energy and consider instead its \emph{total} energy $E$, which includes a contribution from its mass.

On a graph of $p$ versus $E$, massless particles, which have $E\propto|p|$, lie on two diagonal lines that connect at the
origin. If we like, we can pick units such that the slopes of these lines are plus and minus one. Material particles
lie to the right of these lines. For example, a car sitting in a parking lot has $p=0$ and $E=mc^2$. 

Now what happens to such a graph when we change to a different frame or reference that is in motion relative to the
original frame? A massless particle still has to act like a massless particle, so the diagonals are simply stretched
or contracted along their own lengths. A transformation that always takes a line to a line is a linear transformation
(p.~\pageref{fig:nonlinear-transformation}), and if the transformation between different frames of reference preserves
the linearity of the lines $p=E$ and $p=-E$, then it's natural to suspect that it is actually some kind of linear transformation.
In fact the transformation must be linear (p.~\pageref{fig:nonlinear-transformation}), because conservation of
energy and momentum involve addition, and we need these laws to be valid in all frames of reference.
By the same reasoning as in figure \figref{area-proof} on p.~\pageref{fig:area-proof}, the transformation must be area-preserving.
We then have the same three cases to consider as in figure \figref{three-cases} on p.~\pageref{fig:three-cases}.
Case I is ruled out because it would imply that particles keep the same energy when we change frames.
(This is what would happen if $c$ were infinite, so that the mass-equivalent $E/c^2$ of a given energy was zero,
and therefore $E$ would be interpreted purely as the mass.) Case II can't be right because it doesn't preserve
the $E=|p|$ diagonals. We are left with case III, which establishes the following aesthetically appealing
fact: \emph{the $p$-$E$ plane transforms according to exactly the same kind of Lorentz transformation as the $x$-$t$ plane}.
That is, $(E,p_x,p_y,p_z)$ is a four-vector (p.~\pageref{sec:four-vectors}) just like $(t,x,y,z)$. This is a highly
desirable result. If it were not true, it would be like having to learn different mathematical rules for different
kinds of three-vectors in Newtonian mechanics.

The only remaining issue to settle is whether the choice of units that gives invariant 45-degree diagonals in the
$x$-$t$ plane is the same as the choice of units that gives such diagonals in the $p$-$E$ plane.
That is, we need to establish that the $c$ that applies to $x$ and $t$ is equal to the $c'$ needed for $p$ and $E$,
i.e., that the velocity scales of the two graphs are matched up.
This is true because in the Newtonian limit, the total mass-energy $E$ is essentially just the particle's mass,
and then $p/E \approx p/m \approx v$. This establishes that the velocity scales are matched at small velocities,
which implies that they coincide for all velocities, since a large velocity, even one approaching $c$,
can be built up from many small increments. (This also establishes that the exponent $n$ defined on p.~\pageref{pesky-exponent-claim}
equals 1 as claimed.)\label{pesky-exponent-proof}

Suppose that a particle is at rest. Then it has $p=0$ and mass-energy $E$  equal to its mass $m$. Therefore
the inner product of its $(E,p)$ four-vector with itself equals $m^2$. In other words, the ``magnitude'' of
the energy-momentum four-vector is simply equal to the particle's mass. If we transform into a different
frame of reference, the inner product stays the same. We can therefore always interpret the magnitude of
an energy-momentum four-vector as the mass. In symbols,
\begin{equation*}
  m^2 = E^2 - p^2\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
or, in units with $c \ne 1$,
\begin{equation*}
  (mc^2)^2 = E^2 - (pc)^2\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

Since we already have an equation $E=m\gamma$ for the energy of a material particle in terms of
its velocity, we can find a similar equation for the momentum:
\begin{align*}
  p &= \sqrt{E^2-m^2} \\
    &= m\sqrt{\gamma^2-1} \\
    &= m\sqrt{\frac{1}{1-v^2}-1} \\
    &= m\gamma v\eqquad.
\end{align*}
As a material particle gets closer and closer to $c$, its momentum approaches infinity,
so that an infinite force would be required in order to reach $c$.

\begin{eg}{Light rays don't interact}\label{eg:light-rays-do-not-interact}
We observe that when two rays of light cross paths, they continue through one another
without bouncing like material objects. This behavior follows directly from conservation
of energy-momentum.

Any two vectors can be contained in a single plane, so we can choose our coordinates
so that both rays have vanishing $p_z$. By choosing the state of motion of our coordinate
system appropriately, we can also make $p_y=0$, so that the collision takes place along a single line parallel to the $x$ axis.
Since only $p_x$ is nonzero, we
write it simply as $p$. In the resulting $p$-$E$ plane, there are two possibilities:
either the rays both lie along the same diagonal, or they lie along different diagonals.
If they lie along the same diagonal, then there can't be a collision, because the
two rays are both moving in the same direction at the same speed $c$, and the trailing
one will never catch up with the leading one.

Now suppose they lie along different diagonals. We add their energy-momentum vectors
to get their total energy-momentum, which will lie in the gray area of figure \figref{e-p-plane}.
That is, a pair of light rays taken as a single system act sort of like a material object
with a nonzero mass.\footnote{If you construct a box out of mirrors and put some light inside, it
has weight, and theoretically even has a gravitational field! This is an example of the fact
that mass is not additive in relativity. Two objects, each with zero mass, can have an
aggregate mass that is nonzero.} By a Lorentz transformation,
we can always find a frame in which this total energy-momentum vector lies along the $E$
axis. This is a frame in which the momenta of the two rays cancel, and we have
a symmetric head-on collision between two rays of equal energy. It is the ``center-of-mass''
frame, although neither object has any mass on an individual basis.  For convenience, let's
assume that the $x$-$y$-$z$ coordinate system was chosen so that its origin was at rest in this
frame. 

Since the collision occurs along the $x$ axis, by symmetry
it is not possible for the rays after the collision to depart from the $x$ axis; for if they
did, then there would be nothing to determine the orientation of the plane in which they
emerged.\footnote{In quantum mechanics, there is a loophole here.
Quantum mechanics allows certain kinds of randomness, so that the symmetry can be broken by
letting the outgoing rays be observed in a plane with some random orientation.} Therefore
we are justified in continuing to use the same $p_x$-$E$ plane to analyze the four-vectors
of the rays after the collision.

Let each ray have
energy $E$ in the frame described above.
Given this total energy-momentum vector, how can we cook up two energy-momentum vectors
for the final state such that energy and momentum will have been conserved? Since
there is zero total momentum, our only choice is two light rays, one with energy-momentum
vector $(E,E)$ and one with $(E,-E)$. But this is exactly the same as our initial state,
except that we can arbitrarily choose the roles of the two rays to have been interchanged.
Such an interchanging is only a matter of labeling, so there is no observable sense in which
the rays have collided.\footnote{There is a second loophole here, which is that a ray of light
is actually a wave, and a wave has other properties besides energy and momentum. It has
a wavelength, and some waves also have a property called polarization. As a mechanical analogy for polarization,
consider a rope stretched taut. Side-to-side vibrations can propagate along the rope, and
these vibrations can occur in any plane that coincides with the rope. The orientation of this
plane is referred to as the polarization of the wave. Returning to the case of the colliding
light rays, it is possible to have nontrivial collisions in the sense that the rays could
affect one another's wavelengths and polarizations. Although this doesn't actually happen
with non-quantum-mechanical light waves, it can happen with other types of waves; see, e.g.,
Hu et al., \url{arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9502276}, figure 2. The title of example \ref{eg:light-rays-do-not-interact}
is only valid if a ``ray'' is taken to be something that lacks wave structure. The wave nature of
light is not evident in everyday life from observations with apparatus such as
flashlights, mirrors, and eyeglasses, so we expect the
result to hold under those circumstances, and it does. E.g., flashlight beams do pass through one
anther without interacting.}
