An object's center of mass is the point at which it can be
balanced. For the time being, we are studying the mathematical
description only of the motion of an object's center of mass
in cases restricted to one dimension. The motion of an
object's center of mass is usually far simpler than the
motion of any of its other parts.

It is important to distinguish location, $x$, from distance,
$\Delta x$, and clock reading, $t$, from time interval
$\Delta t$. When an object's $x-t$ graph is linear, we
define its velocity as the slope of the line, 
$\Delta x/\Delta t$. When the graph is curved, we generalize the
definition so that the velocity is the
m4_ifelse(__me,1,[:%
derivative $\der x/\der t$.

Galileo's principle of inertia states that no force is
required to maintain motion with constant velocity in a
straight line, and absolute motion does not cause any
observable physical effects. Things typically tend to reduce
their velocity relative to the surface of our planet only
because they are physically rubbing against the planet (or
something attached to the planet), not because there is
anything special about being at rest with respect to the
earth's surface. When it seems, for instance, that a force
is required to keep a book sliding across a table, in fact
the force is only serving to cancel the contrary force of friction.

Absolute motion is not a well-defined concept, and if two
observers are not at rest relative to one another they will
disagree about the absolute velocities of objects. They
will, however, agree about relative velocities. If object A
is in motion relative to object $B$, and $B$ is in motion
relative to $C$, then A's velocity relative to $C$ is given
by $v_{AC}=v_{AB}+v_{BC}$. Positive and negative signs are
used to indicate the direction of an object's motion.

Modern experiments show that space and time only approximately have the properties claimed by Galileo and Newton.
Time and space as seen by one
observer are distorted compared to another observer's perceptions if they are moving
relative to each other. This distortion is quantified by the factor
\begin{equation*}
  \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $v$ is the relative velocity of the two observers, and $c$ is a universal velocity
that is the same in all frames of reference. Light travels at $c$. A clock appears to run fastest to an
observer who is not in motion relative to it, and appears to run too slowly by a factor of
$\gamma$ to an observer who has a velocity $v$ relative to the clock. Similarly, a meter-stick
appears longest to an observer who sees it at rest, and appears shorter to other observers.
Time and space are relative, not absolute. In particular, there is no well-defined concept
of simultaneity. Velocities don't add according to $u+v$ but rather $(u+v)/(1+uv)$ (in units
where $c=1$).

All of these strange effects, however, are very small when the relative
velocities are small compared to $c$. This makes sense, because
Newton's laws have already been thoroughly tested by experiments at such speeds,
so a new theory like relativity must agree with the old one in their realm of
common applicability. This requirement of backwards-compatibility is known as
the correspondence principle.

The figure illustrates a Lorentz transformation using the conventions employed in section \ref{sec:x-t-distortion}.
For simplicity, the transformation chosen is one that lengthens one diagonal by a factor of 2. Since Lorentz transformations
preserve area, the other diagonal is shortened by a factor of 2. Let the original frame of reference, depicted with the square,
be A, and the new one B. (a) By measuring with a ruler on the figure, show that the velocity of frame B relative to frame A is $0.6c$.
(b) Print out a copy of the page. With a ruler, draw a third parallelogram that represents a second successive Lorentz transformation, one
that lengthens the long diagonal by another factor of 2. Call this third frame C. Use measurements with a ruler to determine
frame C's velocity relative to frame A. Does it equal double the velocity found in part a? Explain why it should be expected to turn
out the way it does. A general equation for this type of calculation is derived in problem \ref{hw:me-vel-addition}.\answercheck

The purpose of this problem is to prove the general result $w=(u+v)/(1+uv)$ (in units where $c=1$)
for the kind of combination of velocities found graphically in problem \ref{hw:six-tenths-c-twice}. Suppose that we
perform two Lorentz transformations, with velocities $u$ and $v$, one after the other.
Representing these transformations as distortions of parallelograms, we stretch the stretching diagonals
by factors $S(u)$ and $S(v)$ (and compress the compressing ones by the inverses of these factors), so that the combined result is a stretching by $S(u)S(v)$.
We want to prove that $S(w)=S(u)S(v)$ gives the expression claimed above for $w$. One can easily show
by fiddling with the result of part c of problem \ref{hw:gamma-derivation} that $S(x)=\sqrt{(1+x)/(1-x)}$.
(a) Use these facts to write down an equation relating $u$, $v$, and $w$. (b) Solve for $w$ in terms of $u$ and $v$.
(c) Show that your answer to part b satisfies the correspondence principle.
(d) Show that it is consistent with the constancy of $c$.
