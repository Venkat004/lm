========fig_widths=========
purpose:
  Make it easy for the problems book to be automatically generated, without having
  to specify widths of figures in the code.
format:
  JSON
  is a hash with name of fig as key, width as value, e.g., "jovian-moons":"wide"
  if they're normal width, they're omitted from the file, so explicit widths are either "wide" or "fullpage"
to regenerate it:
  Edit /home/bcrowell/Documents/programming/eruby_util_for_books/eruby_util.rb
  Find the block of code that refers to fig_widths
  Do what the comments say there.
  Make books_all
  Change the code back.
  sort <~/fig_widths | uniq >~/Documents/writing/books/physics/data/fig_widths
  Delete the final comma. Add curly braces at top and bottom. It's now valid JSON.
