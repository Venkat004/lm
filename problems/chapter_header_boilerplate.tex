\noindent\emph{This is not a textbook. It's a book of problems meant to be used
along with a textbook. Although each chapter of this book starts with a brief summary
of the relevant physics, that summary is not meant to be enough to allow the reader
to actually learn the subject from scratch. The purpose of the summary is to show what material
is needed in order to do the problems, and to show what terminology and notation
are being used.}
