This is used to generate the solutions manuals for physics textbooks.
The code is all in the generate_problems.rb script, so there is not
much in this directory other than the makefile and some boilerplate
files.

To make and post encrypted solutions, don't use this directly. Do a
make in the teaching/solns directory. That will indirectly invoke this
makefile.

For the instructor's edition of the problems book, do a make in the
problems book's directory, e.g., problems/calc.

For per-student solutions for 150A, use whiz. The instructors'
solutions manual for Fundamentals of Calculus is generated by
special-purpose scripts in the book's solutions directory.
