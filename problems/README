Assigning difficulty levels to problems:
  % meta {"stars":1} // super hard problem
Figures:
  % fig {"name":"greyhound","caption":"The racing greyhound's velocity vector is
  % in the direction of its motion, i.e., tangent to its curved path."}
In the above syntax, the active latex comments contain a keyword followed by a
JSON string. The JSON string can extend over multiple lines; input will be read
until a complete and syntactically valid JSON string is built up. Newlines are
eliminated, so in the example above, with a multiline string, the space after
the % on the second line is significant. Javascript-style comments are allowed,
but watch out when combining multiline blocks with //-style comments, because the 
newlines  are removed before the comments are removed. It may be safer to use
/*...*/ comments.

The book is arranged in a tree structure of chapters, sections, and problem groups.
Each node in the tree has a configuration file called this.config in its directory.
The configuration file is in JSON format, with comments allowed. Newlines are not
removed, and multiline strings are not allowed.

In most cases, it's OK to associate all the problem groups with the final section
of the chapter.

Explanatory text is in files called text.tex, at the section level. If you want
a remark above a problem group (such as general instructions that apply to all
the problems in the group), you can put the text in a text.tex file at the
problem-group level.
