From these facts about the Lorentz transformation, it can be shown that
different observers disagree about lengths and times in the following
way. Let $\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-v^2}$, where $v$ is the velocity of one
observer relative to another. (In SI units, substitute $v/c$ for $v$.)

A clock appears to run fastest to an observer at rest relative to
the clock. According to other observers, the clock's rate is lower by a factor of $\gamma$.

A meter stick appears longest to an observer at rest relative to     
the stick. An observer in motion parallel to the stick measures
the stick to have been shortened by a factor of $\gamma$.
