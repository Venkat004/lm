For each of the three conserved quantities we have encountered so far, we can define
a rate of transfer or transformation:
\begin{align*}
  P &= \frac{\der E}{\der t} \qquad \text{[power]} \\
  \vc{F} &= \frac{\der\vc{p}}{\der t}  \qquad \text{[force]} \\
  \btau &= \frac{\der\vc{L}}{\der t}  \qquad \text{[torque]}.
\end{align*}
The torque exerted by a force $\vc{F}$ can be expressed as
\begin{align*}
  \btau &= \vc{r}\times\vc{F}.
\end{align*}
For rigid-body rotation about an axis of symmetry, we have
\begin{equation*}
  \alpha = \frac{\btau}{I},
\end{equation*}
which is analogous to Newton's second law.
