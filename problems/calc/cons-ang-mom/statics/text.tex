If an object is to be in \intro{equilibrium},\index{equilibrium} both the total torque and the total force acting on
it must be zero:
\begin{align*}
  \sum \vc{F} &= 0 \\
  \sum \btau &= 0 
\end{align*}
We consider an object to be in equilibrium when these conditions apply, even if it is
moving.

An equilibrium can be stable, like a marble at the bottom of a bowl, unstable,
like a marble placed on top of a hemispherical hill, or neutral, like a marble
placed on a flat tabletop.
