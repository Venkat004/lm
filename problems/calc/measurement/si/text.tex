The Syst\`eme International (SI) is a system of measurement in which
mechanical quantities are expressed in terms of three basic units:
the meter (m), the kilogram (kg), and the second (s).
Other units can be built out of these. For example, the SI
unit to measure the flow of water through a pipe would be kg/s.

To modify the units there is a consistent set of prefixes.
The following are common and
should be memorized:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{prefix} & meaning \\
    nano-   &   n     &$10^{-9}$ \\
    micro-  &  $\mu$  &$10^{-6}$ \\
    milli- &   m   & $10^{-3}$ \\
    kilo-  &   k   & $10^3$ \\
    mega-   &  M      &$10^6$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent The symbol $\mu$, for micro-, is Greek lowercase mu, which is equivalent
to the Latin ``m.'' There is also centi-, $10^{-2}$, which is only used in the
centimeter.
