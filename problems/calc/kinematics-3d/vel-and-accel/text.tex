If an object undergoes an infinitesimal displacement $\der\vc{r}$ in an
infinitesimal time interval $\der t$, then its velocity vector is the derivative
$\vc{v}=\der\vc{r}/\der t$. This type of derivative of a vector can be computed
by differentiating each component separately. The acceleration is the
second derivative $\der^2\vc{r}/\der t^2$.

The velocity vector has a magnitude that indicates the speed of motion, and
a direction that gives the direction of the motion. We saw in section
\ref{sec:kinematics-1d-velocity} that velocities add in relative motion.
To generalize this to more than one dimension, we use vector addition.

The acceleration vector does \emph{not} necessarily point in the direction
of motion. It points in the direction that an accelerometer would point,
as in figure \ref{fig:accelerometer}.

% fig {"name":"accelerometer","caption":"The car has just swerved to the right. The air freshener hanging from the rear-view mirror acts as an accelerometer, showing that the acceleration vector is to the right."}

Forces cause accelerations, not velocities. In particular, the downward force of gravity
causes a downward acceleration vector. After a projectile is launched, the only force
on it is gravity, so its acceleration vector points straight down. Therefore the horizontal
part of its motion has constant velocity. The vertical and horizontal motions of a projectile
are independent. Neither affects the other.
