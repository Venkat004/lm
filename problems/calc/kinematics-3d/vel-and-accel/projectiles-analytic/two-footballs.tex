Two footballs, one white and one green, are on the ground and kicked
by two different footballers. The white ball, which is kicked
straight upwards, rises to a maximum height $H$. The green ball is
hit with twice the initial velocity as compared to the first ball,
but also reaches the same maximum height $H$.\\

(a) If the $y$-component of the white ball's initial velocity vector
is $v_0$, what is the $y$-component of the green ball's initial
velocity vector? Give you answer in terms of $v_0$ alone.\answercheck\hwendpart

(c) What is the range of the green ball? Your answer should only
depend on $H$.\answercheck
