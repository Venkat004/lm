A box is moving with speed $v_0 = 6.0\ \munit/\sunit$ when it
approaches the bottom of a ramp. The ramp is inclined at an angle
$\theta = 30\degunit$ above the horizontal, and the box undergoes a
deceleration of $g \sin \theta = 4.9\ \munit / \sunit^2$ when moving
along the ramp. By the time the box reaches the top of the ramp, its
speed has gone down to $3.0\ \munit / \sunit$.\\
