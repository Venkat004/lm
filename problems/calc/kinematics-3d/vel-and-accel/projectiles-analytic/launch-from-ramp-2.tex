A box is moving with speed $v_0$ when it approaches the bottom of a
ramp. The ramp is inclined at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal,
and the distance along the ramp is $L$. The box undergoes a
deceleration of $g \sin \theta$ when moving along the ramp, and
undergoes freefall due to gravity after being launched off the ramp.\\
