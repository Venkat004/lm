The first time he played golf, now-deceased North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is said to have gotten 11 holes
in one. Suppose that his son, Kim Jong-Un, wants to top his father's feat by hitting a golf ball all the way
from Pyongyang to Seoul, a distance of 195 km. Ignoring air resistance and the curvature of
the earth, how fast does he need to hit the ball? Note that the maximum range (assuming no air
resistance) is achieved for a launch angle of $45\degunit$.
