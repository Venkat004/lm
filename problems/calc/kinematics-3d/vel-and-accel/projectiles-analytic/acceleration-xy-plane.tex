A particle leaves point P at time $t=0\ \sunit$ with initial velocity
$(-2.0\hat{\vc{x}}+4.0\hat{\vc{y}})\ \munit/\sunit$. Point P is located on the
$x$ axis at position $(x,y) = (10.0\ \munit,0)$. If the particle
experiences constant acceleration $\vc{a} = (-5.0\hat{\vc{y}})\ \munit/\sunit^2$,
then which axis does it cross first, $x$ or $y$, and at what location?
