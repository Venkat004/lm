As shown in the figure, you wish to cross a river and arrive at a dock
that is directly across from you, but the river's current
will tend to carry you downstream. To compensate, you must
steer the boat at an angle. Find the angle $\theta $, given
the magnitude, $|\vc{v}_{WL}|$, of the water's velocity relative
to the land, and the maximum speed, $|\vc{v}_{BW}|$, of which the
boat is capable relative to the water.
