Some materials, such as metals, are good electrical conductors, meaning
that they contain charges that are free to move. A material like dry wood
is an insulator, because it contains few such free charges. When a perfect
conductor is in static equilibrium, any net charge is on the surface, and
the electric field is zero on its interior. The electric field at the surface
is perpendicular to the surface.
