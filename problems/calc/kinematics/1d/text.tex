\subsection{Velocity}
The motion of a particle in one dimension can be described using the
function $x(t)$ that gives its position at any time. Its \intro{velocity}\index{velocity!in one dimension} is
defined by the derivative
\begin{equation}
  v = \frac{\der x}{\der t}.
\end{equation}
From the definition, we see that the SI units of velocity are meters per second, m/s.
Positive and negative signs indicate the direction of motion,\index{velocity!in one dimension!sign} relative
to the direction that is arbitrarily called positive when we pick our
coordinate system. In the case of constant velocity, we have
\begin{equation}
  v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t},
\end{equation}
where the notation $\Delta$ (Greek uppercase ``delta,'' like Latin ``D'') means ``change in,''
or ``final minus initial.'' When the velocity is not constant, this equation is false,
although the quantity $\Delta x/\Delta t$ can be interpreted as a kind of average velocity.

Velocity can only be defined if we choose some arbitrary reference point that we consider
to be at rest. Therefore velocity is relative, not absolute. A person aboard a cruising
passenger jet might consider the cabin to be at rest, but someone on the ground might
say that the plane was moving very fast --- relative to the dirt.\index{velocity!is relative}

To convert velocities\index{velocity!converting between frames}
from one \intro{frame of reference} to another, we add a constant. If, for example, $v_{AB}$ is the velocity
of A relative to B, then
\begin{equation}
  v_{AC} = v_{AB}+v_{BC}.
\end{equation}

The \intro{principle of inertia}\index{inertia!principle of}\index{principle of inertia}
states that if an object is not acted on by a force, its
velocity remains constant. For example, if a rolling soccer ball slows down, the change in
its velocity is not because the ball naturally ``wants'' to slow down but because of a frictional
force that the grass exerts on it.

A frame of reference in which the principle of inertia holds
is called an \intro{inertial} frame of reference.\index{frame of reference!inertial}
The earth's surface defines a very nearly inertial
frame of reference, but so does the cabin of a cruising passenger jet. Any frame of reference
moving at constant velocity, in a straight line, relative to an inertial frame is also an
inertial frame. An example of a noninertial frame of reference is a car in an amusement
park ride that maneuvers violently.

\subsection{Acceleration}
The \intro{acceleration}\index{acceleration!defined}
of a particle is defined as the time derivative of the velocity, or
the second derivative of the position with respect to time:
\begin{equation}
  a = \frac{\der v}{\der t} = \frac{\der^2 x}{\der t^2}.
\end{equation}
It measures the rate at which the velocity is changing.
Its units are $\munit/\sunit/\sunit$, more commonly written as $\munit/\sunit^2$.

Unlike velocity, acceleration is not just a matter of opinion.
Observers in different inertial frames of reference agree on accelerations.
An acceleration is caused by the force that one object exerts on another.

In the case of constant acceleration, simple algebra and calculus give the following relations:
\begin{align}
  a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \\
  x &= x_0+v_0t+\frac{1}{2}at^2 \\
  v_f^2 &= v_0^2 + 2a\Delta x,
\end{align}
where the subscript $0$ (read ``nought'') means initial, or $t=0$, and
$f$ means final.

Galileo showed by experiment
that when the only force acting on an object is gravity, the object's acceleration
has a value that is independent of the object's mass. This is because the greater
force of gravity on a heavier object is exactly compensated for by the object's
greater \intro{inertia}, meaning its tendency to resist a change in its motion.
For example, if you stand up now and drop a coin side by side with your shoe, you
should see them hit the ground at almost the same time, despite the huge disparity
in mass. The magnitude of the acceleration of falling objects is notated 
$g$, and near the earth's
surface $g$ is approximately $9.8\ \munit/\sunit^2$. This number is a measure of
the strength of the earth's gravitational field.

\subsection{Graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration}

The motion of an object can be represented visually by a stack of graphs
of $x$ versus $t$, $v$ versus $t$, and $a$ versus $t$.
Figure \ref{fig:sample-xva-graphs} shows two examples. The slope of the tangent
line at a given point on one graph equals the value of the function at the
same time in the graph below.

acceleration of $1\ \munit/\sunit^2$. 2.~Graphs for a parachute jumper who initially accelerates
at $g$, but later accelerates more slowly due to air resistance.}
