A collision is an interaction between particles in which the particles interact
over some period of time and then stop interacting. It is assumed that external
forces are negligible. Often the result of a collision can be uniquely predicted
by simultaneously imposing conservation of energy and conservation of momentum,
\begin{align}
  \sum E_j &= \sum E_j' \\
  \sum \vc{p}_k &= \sum \vc{p}_k' ,
\end{align}
where $j$ runs over the types of energy and $k$ over the particles.

Some collisions are highly elastic, meaning that little or no kinetic energy is
transformed into other forms, such as heat or sound. Other collisions, for example
car crashes, are highly inelastic. Unless we have some reason to believe that
the collision is elastic, we cannot assume that the total \emph{kinetic} energy
is conserved.
