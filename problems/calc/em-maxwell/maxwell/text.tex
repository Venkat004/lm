The fundamental laws of physics governing
	electric and magnetic fields are Maxwell's equations, which state that
	for any closed surface, the fluxes through the surface are
	\begin{align*}
		\Phi_E		&= 4\pi kq_{in} \qquad\qquad\qquad \text{and}\\
		\Phi_B		&= 0\eqquad.\\
	\intertext{For any surface that is not closed, the circulations 
	around the edges of the surface are given by}
		\Gamma_E 	&= -\frac{\partial\Phi_B}{\partial t}  \qquad\qquad\qquad \text{and} \\
		c^2\Gamma_B 	&= \frac{\partial\Phi_E}{\partial t}  + 4\pi k I_{through}\eqquad.
	\end{align*}
