A complete statement of Maxwell's equations in the presence of electric and magnetic materials is as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \Phi_D &= q_\text{free} \\
    \Phi_B &= 0 \\
    \Gamma_E &= -\frac{\der \Phi_B}{\der t} \\
    \Gamma_H &= \frac{\der \Phi_D}{\der t} + I_\text{free}\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where the auxiliary fields $\vc{D}$ and $\vc{H}$ are defined as
\begin{align*}
  \vc{D} &=\epsilon \vc{E} \qquad  \text{and}\\
  \vc{H} &= \frac{\vc{B}}{\mu}\eqquad,
\end{align*}
and $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ are the permittivity and permeability of the substance.
