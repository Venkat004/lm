	The most important result of Maxwell's equations is the existence of
	electromagnetic waves which propagate at the velocity of light --- that's
	what light is. The waves are transverse, and the electric and magnetic fields
	are perpendicular to each other. There are no purely electric or purely magnetic
	waves; their amplitudes are always related to one another by $B=E/c$. They propagate
	in the right-handed direction given by the cross product $\vc{E}\times\vc{B}$, and
	carry momentum $p=U/c$.
