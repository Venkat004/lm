Kirchoff's junction rule is a statement of conservation of charge. It says that
the sum of the currents flowing into any junction in a circuit must be zero (if
the junction has no way to store charge).

Kirchoff's loop rule is a statement of conservation of energy. For any loop in
a circuit, the sum of the voltage drops must be zero.
