Electric current is defined as the rate of flow of charge through a
boundary, $I=\der q/\der t$.  Its units of coulombs/second are more
conveniently abbreviated as amperes, 1 A=1 C/s. 
Current is measured by an ammeter, which allows current to flow through itself.
An ammeter is wired in series with a circuit, which requires breaking the circuit
in order to insert the meter.
An ideal ammeter acts like a perfect conductor.

The power dissipated, transformed, or released in an electric circuit element
is given by $P=I\Delta V$.
