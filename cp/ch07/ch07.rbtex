Ads for one Macintosh computer bragged that it could do an
arithmetic calculation in less time than it took for the
light to get from the screen to your eye. We find this
impressive because of the contrast between the speed of
light and the speeds at which we interact with physical
objects in our environment. Perhaps it shouldn't surprise
us, then, that Newton succeeded so well in explaining the
motion of objects, but was far less successful with the study of light.

The climax of our study of
electricity and magnetism was discovery that light is an
electromagnetic wave. Knowing this, however, is not the same
as knowing everything about eyes and telescopes. In fact,
the full description of light as a wave can be rather
cumbersome. In this chapter, we'll instead make
use of a simpler model of light, the ray model, which does a
fine job in most practical situations. Not only that, but we'll
even backtrack a little and start with a discussion of
basic ideas about light and vision that predated the
discovery of electromagnetic waves.

<% begin_sec("The nature of light") %>

<% begin_sec("The cause and effect relationship in vision") %>

Despite its title, this chapter is far from your first look
at light. That familiarity might seem like an advantage, but
most people have never thought carefully about light and
vision. Even smart people who have thought hard about vision
have come up with incorrect ideas. The ancient Greeks, Arabs
and Chinese had theories of light and \index{vision}vision,
all of which were mostly wrong, and all of which were
accepted for thousands of years.

One thing the ancients did get right is that there is a
distinction between objects that emit light and objects that
don't. When you see a leaf in the forest, it's because three
different objects are doing their jobs: the leaf, the eye,
and the sun. But luminous objects like the sun, a flame, or
the filament of a light bulb can be seen by the eye without
the presence of a third object. Emission of light is often,
but not always, associated with heat. In modern times, we
are familiar with a variety of objects that glow without
being heated, including fluorescent lights and glow-in-the-dark toys.

How do we see luminous objects? The Greek philosophers
\index{Pythagoras}Pythagoras (b. ca. 560 BC) and \index{Empedocles
of Acragas}Empedocles of Acragas (b. ca. 492 BC), who
unfortunately were very influential, claimed that when you
looked at a candle flame, the flame and your eye were both
sending out some kind of mysterious stuff, and when your
eye's stuff collided with the candle's stuff, the candle
would become evident to your sense of sight.

Bizarre as the Greek ``collision of stuff theory'' might
seem, it had a couple of good features. It explained why
both the candle and your eye had to be present for your
sense of sight to function. The theory could also easily be
expanded to explain how we see nonluminous objects. If a
leaf, for instance, happened to be present at the site of
the collision between your eye's stuff and the candle's
stuff, then the leaf would be stimulated to express its
green nature, allowing you to perceive it as green.

Modern people might feel uneasy about this theory, since it
suggests that greenness exists only for our seeing
convenience, implying a human precedence over natural
phenomena. Nowadays, people would expect the cause and
effect relationship in vision to be the other way around,
with the leaf doing something to our eye rather than our eye
doing something to the leaf. But how can you tell? The most
common way of distinguishing cause from effect is to
determine which happened first, but the process of seeing
seems to occur too quickly to determine the order in which
things happened. Certainly there is no obvious time lag
between the moment when you move your head and the moment
when your reflection in the mirror moves.

Today, photography provides the simplest experimental
evidence that nothing has to be emitted from your eye and
hit the leaf in order to make it ``greenify.'' A camera can
take a picture of a leaf even if there are no eyes anywhere
nearby. Since the leaf appears green regardless of whether
it is being sensed by a camera, your eye, or an insect's
eye, it seems to make more sense to say that the leaf's
greenness is the cause, and something happening in the
camera or eye is the effect.

Another issue that few people have considered is whether a
candle's flame simply affects your eye directly, or whether
it sends out light which then gets into your eye. Again, the
rapidity of the effect makes it difficult to tell what's
happening. If someone throws a rock at you, you can see the
rock on its way to your body, and you can tell that the
person affected you by sending a material substance your
way, rather than just harming you directly with an arm
motion, which would be known as ``action at a distance.'' It
is not easy to do a similar observation to see whether there
is some ``stuff'' that travels from the candle to your eye,
or whether it is a case of action at a distance.

Our description of the physics of material objects included both action at a distance (e.g.,
the earth's gravitational force on a falling object) and
contact forces such as friction.

    }

%>
<% end_marg %>

One piece of evidence that the candle sends out stuff that
travels to your eye is that as in figure \figref{deflection-of-candle-light}, intervening transparent
substances can make the candle appear to be in the wrong
location, suggesting that light is a thing that can be
bumped off course. Many people would dismiss this kind of
observation as an optical illusion, however. (Some optical
illusions are purely neurological or psychological effects,
although some others, including this one, turn out to be
caused by the behavior of light itself.)

A more convincing way to decide in which category light
belongs is to find out if it takes time to get from the
candle to your eye; in Newton's picture of the universe, action at a
distance was supposed to be instantaneous. The fact that we
speak casually today of ``the speed of light'' implies that
at some point in history, somebody succeeded in showing that
light did not travel infinitely fast. Galileo tried, and
failed, to detect a finite speed for light, by arranging
with a person in a distant tower to signal back and forth
with lanterns. \index{Galileo}Galileo uncovered his lantern,
and when the other person saw the light, he uncovered his
lantern. Galileo was unable to measure any time lag that was
significant compared to the limitations of human reflexes.

The first person to prove that light's speed was finite, and
to determine it numerically, was Ole \index{Roemer}Roemer,
in a series of measurements around the year 1675. Roemer
observed Io, one of Jupiter's moons, over a period of
several years. Since \index{Io}Io presumably took the same
amount of time to complete each orbit of \index{Jupiter}Jupiter,
it could be thought of as a very distant, very accurate
clock. A practical and accurate pendulum clock had recently
been invented, so Roemer could check whether the ratio of
the two clocks' cycles, about 42.5 hours to 1 orbit, stayed
exactly constant or changed a little. If the process of
seeing the distant moon was instantaneous, there would be no
reason for the two to get out of step. Even if the speed of
light was finite, you might expect that the result would be
only to offset one cycle relative to the other. The earth
does not, however, stay at a constant distance from Jupiter
and its moons. Since the distance is changing gradually due
to the two planets' orbital motions, a finite speed of light
would make the ``Io clock'' appear to run faster as the
planets drew near each other, and more slowly as their
separation increased. Roemer did find a variation in the
apparent speed of Io's orbits, which caused Io's eclipses by
Jupiter (the moments when Io passed in front of or behind
Jupiter) to occur about 7 minutes early when the earth was
closest to Jupiter, and 7 minutes late when it was farthest.
Based on these measurements, Roemer estimated the speed of
light to be approximately $2\times10^8$ m/s, which is in
the right ballpark compared to modern measurements of
$3\times10^8$ m/s. (I'm not sure whether the fairly large
experimental error was mainly due to imprecise knowledge of
the radius of the earth's orbit or limitations in the
reliability of pendulum clocks.)

      and receding from Jupiter and Io, so Io will appear to revolve around Jupiter more slowly.

Many people are confused by the relationship between sound
and light. Although we use different organs to sense them,
there are some similarities. For instance, both light and
sound are typically emitted in all directions by their
sources. Musicians even use visual metaphors like ``tone
color,'' or ``a bright timbre'' to describe sound. One way
to see that they are clearly different phenomena is to note
their very different velocities. Sure, both are pretty fast
compared to a flying arrow or a galloping horse, but as we've
seen, the speed of light is so great as to appear
instantaneous in most situations. The speed of sound,
however, can easily be observed just by watching a group of
schoolchildren a hundred feet away as they clap their hands
to a song. There is an obvious delay between when you see
their palms come together and when you hear the clap.

The fundamental distinction between sound and light is that
sound is an oscillation in air pressure, so it requires air
(or some other medium such as water) in which to travel.
Today, we know that outer space is a vacuum, so the fact
that we get light from the sun, moon and stars clearly shows
that air is not necessary for the propagation of light.

<% begin_sec("Interaction of light with matter") %>

\index{absorption}\index{light!absorption of}
<% begin_sec("Absorption of light") %>

The reason why the sun feels warm on your skin is that the
sunlight is being absorbed, and the light energy is being
transformed into heat energy. The same happens with
artificial light, so the net result of leaving a light
turned on is to heat the room. It doesn't matter whether the
source of the light is hot, like the sun, a flame, or an
incandescent light bulb, or cool, like a fluorescent bulb.
(If your house has electric heat, then there is absolutely
no point in fastidiously turning off lights in the winter;
the lights will help to heat the house at the same dollar
rate as the electric heater.)

This process of heating by absorption is entirely different
from heating by thermal conduction, as when an electric
stove heats spaghetti sauce through a pan. Heat can only be
conducted through matter, but there is vacuum between us and
the sun, or between us and the filament of an incandescent
bulb. Also, heat conduction can only transfer heat energy
from a hotter object to a colder one, but a cool fluorescent
bulb is perfectly capable of heating something that had
already started out being warmer than the bulb itself.

<% begin_sec("How we see nonluminous objects") %>

Not all the light energy that hits an object is transformed
into heat. Some is reflected, and this leads us to the
question of how we see nonluminous objects. If you ask the
average person how we see a light bulb, the most likely
answer is ``The light bulb makes light, which hits our
eyes.'' But if you ask how we see a book, they are likely to
say ``The bulb lights up the room, and that lets me see the
book.'' All mention of light actually entering our eyes has
mysteriously disappeared.

Most people would disagree if you told them that light was
reflected from the book to the eye, because they think of
reflection as something that mirrors do, not something that
a book does. They associate reflection with the formation of
a reflected image, which does not seem to appear in a piece of paper.

Imagine that you are looking at your reflection in a nice
smooth piece of aluminum foil, fresh off the roll. You
perceive a face, not a piece of metal. Perhaps you also see
the bright reflection of a lamp over your shoulder behind
you. Now imagine that the foil is just a little bit less
smooth. The different parts of the image are now a little
bit out of alignment with each other. Your brain can still
recognize a face and a lamp, but it's a little scrambled,
like a Picasso painting. Now suppose you use a piece of
aluminum foil that has been crumpled up and then flattened
out again. The parts of the image are so scrambled that you
cannot recognize an image. Instead, your brain tells you
you're looking at a rough, silvery surface.

Mirror-like reflection at a specific angle is known as
specular reflection, and random reflection in many
directions is called \index{diffuse reflection}\index{reflection!diffuse}diffuse
reflection. Diffuse reflection is how we see nonluminous
objects. Specular reflection only allows us to see images of
objects other than the one doing the reflecting. In top part
of figure \figref{selfportraits}, imagine that the rays of light are coming
from the sun. If you are looking down at the reflecting
surface, there is no way for your eye-brain system to tell
that the rays are not really coming from a sun down below you.

Figure \figref{reading-with-lamp} shows another example of how we can't avoid the
conclusion that light bounces off of things other than
mirrors. The lamp is one I have in my house. It has a bright
bulb, housed in a completely opaque bowl-shaped metal shade.
The only way light can get out of the lamp is by going up
out of the top of the bowl. The fact that I can read a book
in the position shown in the figure means that light must be
bouncing off of the ceiling, then bouncing off of the book,
then finally getting to my eye.

<% end_marg %>


This is where the shortcomings of the Greek theory of vision
become glaringly obvious. In the Greek theory, the light
from the bulb and my mysterious ``eye rays'' are both
supposed to go to the book, where they collide, allowing me
to see the book. But we now have a total of four objects:
lamp, eye, book, and ceiling. Where does the ceiling come
in? Does it also send out its own mysterious ``ceiling
rays,'' contributing to a three-way collision at the book?
That would just be too bizarre to believe!

The differences among white, black, and the various shades
of gray in between is a matter of what percentage of the
light they absorb and what percentage they reflect. That's
why light-colored clothing is more comfortable in the
summer, and light-colored upholstery in a car stays cooler
that dark upholstery.

Note how I've been casually diagramming the motion of light
with pictures showing light rays as lines on the page. Figure
\figref{sample-ray-diagrams} shows some more examples. More
formally, this is known as the ray model of light. The ray
model of light seems natural once we convince ourselves that
light travels through space, and observe phenomena like
sunbeams coming through holes in clouds. If you've read chapter 6,
you've already been
introduced to the concept of light as an electromagnetic
wave, and you know that the ray model is not the ultimate truth
about light, but the ray model is simpler, and in any case
science always deals with models of reality, not the
ultimate nature of reality. Figure \figref{three-models-of-light} summarizes
three models of light.

The ray model is a generic one. By using it we
can discuss the path taken by the light, without committing
ourselves to any specific description of what it is that is
moving along that path. We will use the nice simple ray
model for rest of this chapter, and with it we can analyze a
great many devices and phenomena.

Note that the statements about the applicability of the
various models are only rough guides. For instance, wave
interference effects are often detectable, if small, when
light passes around an obstacle that is quite a bit bigger
than a wavelength. Also, the criterion for when we need the
particle model really has more to do with energy scales than
distance scales, although the two turn out to be related.


The alert reader may have noticed that the wave model is
required at scales smaller than a wavelength of light (on
the order of a micrometer for visible light), and the
particle model is demanded on the atomic scale or lower (a
typical atom being a nanometer or so in size). This implies
that at the smallest scales we need \emph{both} the wave
model and the particle model. They appear incompatible, so
how can we simultaneously use both? The answer is that they
are not as incompatible as they seem. Light is both a wave
and a particle, and a full understanding of this apparently
nonsensical statement would lead us to a discussion of
the quantum physics revolution of the twentieth century.

Specular reflection obeys two simple geometrical rules:

\begin{itemize}

\item The angle of the reflected ray is the same as that
of the incident ray.

\item The reflected ray lies in the plane containing the
incident ray and the normal (perpendicular) line. This plane
is known as the plane of incidence.

The two angles can be defined either with respect to the
normal, like angles B and C in the figure, or with
respect to the reflecting surface, like angles A and D.
There is a convention of several hundred years' standing
that one measures the angles with respect to the normal,
but the rule about equal angles can logically be stated
either as B=C or as A=D.

Figure \figref{fish} shows some guidelines for using ray
diagrams effectively. The light rays bend when then pass out
through the surface of the water (a phenomenon that we'll
discuss in more detail later). The rays appear to have come
from a point above the goldfish's actual location, an effect
that is familiar to people who have tried spear-fishing.

\begin{itemize}
\item A stream of light is not really confined to a finite
number of narrow lines. We just draw it that way. In \figref{fish}/1, it
has been necessary to choose a finite number of rays to draw
(five), rather than the theoretically infinite number of
rays that will diverge from that point.

\item There is a tendency to conceptualize rays incorrectly as
objects. In his Optics, Newton goes out of his way to
caution the reader against this, saying that some people
``consider ... the refraction of ... rays to be the bending
or breaking of them in their passing out of one medium into
another.'' But a ray is a record of the path traveled by
light, not a physical thing that can be bent or broken.

\item In theory, rays may continue infinitely far into the past
and future, but we need to draw lines of finite length. In
\figref{fish}/1, a judicious choice has been made as to where to begin
and end the rays. There is no point in continuing the rays
any farther than shown, because nothing new and exciting is
going to happen to them. There is also no good reason to
start them earlier, before being reflected by the fish,
because the direction of the diffusely reflected rays is
random anyway, and unrelated to the direction of the
original, incoming ray.

\item When representing diffuse reflection in a ray diagram,
many students have a mental block against drawing many rays
fanning out from the same point. Often, as in example \figref{fish}/2,
the problem is the misconception that light can only be
reflected in one direction from one point.

\item Another difficulty associated with diffuse reflection,
example \figref{fish}/3, is the tendency to think that in addition to
drawing many rays coming out of one point, we should also be
drawing many rays coming from many points. In \figref{fish}/1, drawing
many rays coming out of one point gives useful information,
telling us, for instance, that the fish can be seen from any
angle. Drawing many sets of rays, as in \figref{fish}/3, does not give
us any more useful information, and just clutters up the
picture in this example. The only reason to draw sets of
rays fanning out from more than one point would be if
different things were happening to the different sets.

Energy is conserved, so a ray of light should theoretically be able to cross an
infinite distance without losing any of its intensity, provided that it's traveling
through empty space, so that there's no matter that it can give its energy away to.
In that case, why does a distant candle appear dim? Likewise, our sun is just
a star like any other star, but it appears much brighter because it's so much
closer to us. Why are the other stars so dim if not because their light gets ``tired,'' or ``wears out?''
It's not that the light rays are stopping, it's that they're
getting spread out more thinly. The light comes out of the source in all directions, and if you're
very far away, only a tiny percentage of the light will go into your eye. (If all the
light from a star went into your eye, you'd be in trouble.)

Figure \figref{inversesquare} shows what happens if you double your distance from the source. The
light from the flame spreads out in all directions. We pick four
representative rays from among those
that happen to pass through the nearer square. Of these four,
only one passes through the square of equal area at twice the distance. If the
two equal-area squares were people's eyes, then only one fourth of the light would
go into the more distant person's eye.


Another way
of thinking about it is that the light that passed through the first square spreads
out and makes a bigger square; at double the distance, the square is twice as wide and
twice as tall, so its area is $2\times2=4$ times greater. The same light has been spread
out over four times the area.

In general,
the rule works like this:
\begin{align*}
        \text{distance}\times2 &\Rightarrow \text{brightness}\times\frac{1}{4}\\
        \text{distance}\times3 &\Rightarrow \text{brightness}\times\frac{1}{9}\\
        \text{distance}\times4 &\Rightarrow \text{brightness}\times\frac{1}{16}
\end{align*}
To get the 4, we multiplied 2 by itself, 9 came from multiplying 3 by itself, and so on.
Multiplying a number by itself is called squaring it, and dividing one by a number
is called inverting it, so a relationship like this is known as an inverse square law.
Inverse square laws are very common in physics: they occur whenever something is spreading
out in all directions from a point. Physicists already knew about this kind of inverse
square law, for light, before Newton found out that the force of gravity varied as an
inverse square, so his law of gravity made sense to them intuitively, and they were
ready to accept it. However, Newton's law of gravity doesn't describe gravity as a
substance that physically travels outward through space, so it's only a rough
analogy. (One modern hypothesis about gravity is that the messages of gravitational
attraction between two objects are actually carried by little particles, called gravitons,
but nobody has ever detected a graviton directly.)

\eganswer This is an example involving sound. Although sound isn't the same as light,
it does spread out in all directions from a source, so it obeys the inverse-square
law. In the previous examples, we knew the distance and wanted to find the intensity
(brightness). Here, we know about the intensity (loudness), and we want to find out
about the distance. Rather than taking a number and multiplying it by itself to find the
answer, we need to reverse the process, and find the number that, when multiplied by
itself, gives four. In other words, we're computing the square root of four, which is
two. They will double their range, not quadruple it.

In bright sunlight, your pupils contract to admit less light. At night they dilate,
becoming bigger ``light buckets.''
Your perception of brightness depends not only on the true brightness of the source
and your distance from it, but also on how much area your pupils present to the light.
Cameras have a similar mechanism, which is easy to see if you detach the lens
and its housing from the body of the camera, as shown in the figure. Here, the diameter of
the largest aperture is about ten times greater than that of the smallest aperture.
Making a circle ten times greater in radius increases its area by a factor of 100, so
the light-gathering power of the camera becomes 100 times greater. (Many people expect
that the area would only be ten times greater, but if you start drawing copies of the
small circle inside the large circle, you'll see that ten are not nearly enough to
fill in the entire area of the larger circle. Both the width and the height of the
bigger circle are ten times greater, so its area is 100 times greater.)

Example \ref{eg:alphacdistance} on page \pageref{eg:alphacdistance} showed how we
can use brightness to determine distance, but your eye-brain system has a different method.
Right now, you can tell how far away this page is from your eyes. This sense of
depth perception comes from the fact that your two eyes show you the same scene
from two different perspectives. If you wink one eye and then the other, the page will
appear to shift back and forth a little.

If you were looking at a fly on the bridge
of your nose, there would be an angle of nearly $180\degunit$ between the ray that
went into your left eye and the one that went into your right. Your brain would know
that this large angle implied a very small distance. This is called the parallax
angle. Objects at greater distances have smaller parallax angles, and when the angles
are small, it's a good approximation to say that the angle is inversely proportional
to the distance. In figure \figref{parallax}, the parallax angle is almost exactly
cut in half when the person moves twice as far away.

Parallax can be observed in other ways than with a pair of eyeballs.
As a child, you noticed that when you walked around on a moonlit evening,
the moon seemed to follow you. The moon wasn't really following you, and this isn't
even a special property of the moon. It's just that as you walk, you expect to observe
a parallax angle between the same scene viewed from different positions of your whole head.
Very distant objects, including those on the Earth's surface, have parallax
angles too small to notice by walking back and forth. In general, rays coming from
a very distant object are nearly parallel.

If your baseline is long enough, however, the small parallaxes of even very distant objects
may be detectable. In the nineteenth century, nobody knew how tall the Himalayas were,
or exactly where their peaks were on a map, and the Andes were generally believed to be the
tallest mountains in the world. The Himalayas had never been climbed, and could only be viewed
from a distance. From down on the plains of India, there was no way to tell whether they were
very tall mountains very far away, or relatively low ones that were much closer. British
surveyor George Everest finally established their true distance, and astounding height,
by observing the same peaks through a telescope from different locations far apart.

An even more spectacular feat of measurement was carried out by Hipparchus over\index{Hipparchus}\index{moon!distance to}
twenty-one centuries ago. By measuring the parallax of the moon as observed from
Alexandria and the Hellespont, he determined its distance to be about 90 times
the radius of the earth.\footnote{The reason this was
a hard measurement was that accurate clocks hadn't been invented, so there was no
easy way to synchronize the two observations, and the desired effect would be masked
by the apparent motion of the moon across the sky as it rose and set. Hipparchus's trick
was to do the measurement during a solar eclipse, so that people at both locations
would know they were in sync.}\label{hipparchusmoondistance}

The earth circles the sun, \figref{stellarparallax}, and we can therefore determine the distances to a few
hundred of the nearest stars by making observations six months apart, so that the
baseline for the parallax measurement is the diameter of the earth's orbit. For these
stars, the distances derived from parallax can be checked against the ones found by
the method of example \ref{eg:alphacdistance} on page \pageref{eg:alphacdistance}. They
do check out, which verifies the assumption that the stars
are objects analogous to our sun.

<% begin_sec("Reversibility of light rays") %>\index{time reversal}\index{reversibility}

The fact that specular reflection displays equal angles of
incidence and reflection means that there is a symmetry: if
the ray had come in from the right instead of the left in
the figure above, the angles would have looked exactly the
same. This is not just a pointless detail about specular
reflection. It's a manifestation of a very deep and
important fact about nature, which is that the laws of
physics do not distinguish between past and future.
Cannonballs and planets have trajectories that are equally
natural in reverse, and so do light rays. This type of
symmetry is called time-reversal symmetry.

Typically, time-reversal symmetry is a characteristic of any
process that does not involve heat. For instance, the
planets do not experience any friction as they travel
through empty space, so there is no frictional heating. We
should thus expect the time-reversed versions of their
orbits to obey the laws of physics, which they do. In
contrast, a book sliding across a table does generate heat
from friction as it slows down, and it is therefore not
surprising that this type of motion does not appear to obey
time-reversal symmetry. A book lying still on a flat table
is never observed to spontaneously start sliding, sucking up
heat energy and transforming it into kinetic energy.

Similarly, the only situation we've observed so far where
light does not obey time-reversal symmetry is absorption,
which involves heat. Your skin absorbs visible light from
the sun and heats up, but we never observe people's skin to
glow, converting heat energy into visible light. People's
skin does glow in infrared light, but that doesn't mean the
situation is symmetric. Even if you absorb infrared, you
don't emit visible light, because your skin isn't hot enough
to glow in the visible spectrum.

\begin{eg}{Ray tracing on a computer}
A number of techniques can be used for creating artificial visual scenes in
computer graphics. Figure \figref{computer-ray-tracing} shows such a scene,
which was created by the brute-force technique of simply constructing a very
detailed ray diagram on a computer. This technique requires a great deal of
computation, and is therefore too slow to be used for video games and computer-animated movies.
One trick for speeding up the computation is to exploit the reversibility of light
rays. If one was to trace every ray emitted by every illuminated surface, only
a tiny fraction of those would actually end up passing into the virtual ``camera,''
and therefore almost all of the computational effort would be wasted. One can instead
start a ray at the camera, trace it backward in time, and see where it would have
come from. With this technique, there is no wasted effort.

There is another way of stating the rules of reflection that
is very simple and beautiful, and turns out to have deep
consequences and apply much more broadly, not just to reflection. It is called
the principle of least time, or Fermat's principle. \index{Fermat's principle}\index{least time, principle of}

      path such as APC that connects A and C, and therefore AQB must be shorter than any path such as APB.

%>
<% end_marg %>

Let's start with the motion of light that is not interacting
with matter at all. In a vacuum, a light ray moves in a
straight line. This can be rephrased as follows: of all the
conceivable paths light could follow from P to Q, the
only one that is physically possible is the path that
takes the least time.

What about reflection? If light is going to go from one
point to another, being reflected on the way, the quickest
path is indeed the one with equal angles of incidence and
reflection. If the starting and ending points are equally
far from the reflecting surface, \figref{least-time-refl-1}, it's not hard to
convince yourself that this is true, just based on symmetry.
There is also a tricky and simple proof, shown in figure \figref{least-time-refl-2},
for the more general case where the
points are at different distances from the surface.

Not only does the principle of least time work for light in
a vacuum and light undergoing reflection, we will also see
in a later chapter that it works for the bending of light
when it passes from one medium into another.

Although it is beautiful that the entire ray model of light
can be reduced to one simple rule, the principle of least
time, it may seem a little spooky to speak as if the ray of
light is intelligent, and has carefully planned ahead to
find the shortest route to its destination. How does it know
in advance where it's going? What if we moved the mirror
while the light was en route, so conditions along its
planned path were not what it ``expected?'' The answer is
that the principle of least time is really an approximate shortcut for
finding certain results of the wave model of light.

There are a couple of subtle points about the principle of
least time. First, the path does not have to be the quickest
of all possible paths; it only needs to be quicker than any
path that differs infinitesimally from it. In figure \figref{least-time-refl-2},
for instance, light could get from A to B either by the
reflected path AQB or simply by going straight from A to
B. Although AQB is not the shortest possible path, it
cannot be shortened by changing it infinitesimally, e.g., by
moving Q a little to the right or left. On the other hand,
path APB is physically impossible, because it is possible to
improve on it by moving point P infinitesimally to the right.

It's not quite right to call this
the principle of \emph{least} time. In figure \figref{least-time-ellipse}, for
example, the four physically possible paths by which a ray
can return to the center consist of two shortest-time paths
and two longest-time paths. Strictly speaking, we should
refer to the \emph{principle of least or greatest time}, but
most physicists omit the niceties, and assume that other
physicists understand that both maxima and minima are possible.

Infants are always fascinated by the antics of the Baby in
the Mirror. Now if you want to know something about mirror
images that most people don't understand, try this. First
bring this page closer wand closer to your eyes, until you
can no longer focus on it without straining. Then go in the
bathroom and see how close you can get your face to the
surface of the mirror before you can no longer easily focus
on the image of your own eyes. You will find that the
shortest comfortable eye-mirror distance is much less than
the shortest comfortable eye-paper distance. This demonstrates
that the image of your face in the mirror acts as if it had
depth and existed in the space \emph{behind} the mirror. If
the image was like a flat picture in a book, then you
wouldn't be able to focus on it from such a short distance.

In this chapter we will study the images formed by flat and
curved mirrors on a qualitative, conceptual basis. Although
this type of image is not as commonly encountered in
everyday life as images formed by lenses, images formed by
reflection are simpler to understand.

We can understand a mirror image using a ray diagram. Figure \figref{flat-mirror}
 shows several light rays, 1, that originated by
diffuse reflection at the person's nose. They bounce off the
mirror, producing new rays, 2. To anyone whose eye is in
the right position to get one of these rays, they appear to
have come from a behind the mirror, 3, where they would
have originated from a single point. This point is where the
tip of the image-person's nose appears to be. A similar
analysis applies to every other point on the person's face,
so it looks as though there was an entire face behind the
mirror. The customary way of describing the situation
requires some explanation:

\begin{description}

\item[Customary description in physics:] There is an image of the
face behind the mirror.

\item[Translation:] The pattern of rays coming from the mirror is
exactly the same as it would be if there was a face behind
the mirror. Nothing is really behind the mirror.

\end{description}

This is referred to as a \emph{virtual} image, because the
rays do not actually cross at the point behind the mirror.
They only appear to have originated there.

Imagine that the person in figure \figref{flat-mirror} moves his face down
quite a bit --- a couple of feet in real life, or a few
inches on this scale drawing. Draw a new ray diagram. Will
there still be an image? If so, where is it visible from?

The geometry of specular reflection tells us that rays 1 and
2 are at equal angles to the normal (the imaginary
perpendicular line piercing the mirror at the point of
reflection). This means that ray 2's imaginary continuation,
3, forms the same angle with the mirror as ray 1. Since
each ray of type 3 forms the same angles with the mirror
as its partner of type 1, we see that the distance of the
image from the mirror is the same as the actual face from
the mirror, and lies directly across from it. The image
therefore appears to be the same size as the actual face.

An image in a flat mirror is a pretechnological example:
even animals can look at their reflections in a calm pond.
We now pass to our first nontrivial example of the
manipulation of an image by technology: an image in a
curved mirror. Before we dive in, let's consider why this is
an important example. If it was just a question of
memorizing a bunch of facts about curved mirrors, then you
would rightly rebel against an effort to spoil the beauty of
your liberally educated brain by force-feeding you
technological trivia. The reason this is an important
example is not that curved mirrors are so important in and
of themselves, but that the results we derive for curved
bowl-shaped mirrors turn out to be true for a large class of
other optical devices, including mirrors that bulge outward
rather than inward, and lenses as well. A microscope or a
telescope is simply a combination of lenses or mirrors or
both. What you're really learning about here is the basic
building block of all optical devices from movie projectors to octopus eyes.

Because the mirror in figure \figref{virtual} is curved, it bends the
rays back closer together than a flat mirror would: we
describe it as \index{converging}\emph{converging}. Note that the
term refers to what it does to the light rays, not to the
physical shape of the mirror's surface . (The surface itself
would be described as \emph{concave}. The term is not all
that hard to remember, because the hollowed-out interior of
the mirror is like a cave.) It is surprising but true that
all the rays like 3 really do converge on a point, forming
a good image. We will not prove this fact, but it is true
for any mirror whose curvature is gentle enough and that is
symmetric with respect to rotation about the perpendicular
line passing through its center (not asymmetric like a
potato chip). The old-fashioned method of making mirrors and
lenses is by grinding them in grit by hand, and this
automatically tends to produce an almost perfect spherical surface.

Bending a ray like 2 inward implies bending its imaginary
continuation 3 outward, in the same way that raising one
end of a seesaw causes the other end to go down. The image
therefore forms deeper behind the mirror. This doesn't just
show that there is extra distance between the image-nose and
the mirror; it also implies that the image itself is bigger
from front to back. It has been \index{magnification!by a converging mirror}\emph{magnified} in the front-to-back direction.

<% marg(0) %>
<%
  fig(
    'curved-mirror-mag',
    %q{%
      The image is magnified by the same factor in
      depth and in its other dimensions.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
It is easy to prove that the same magnification also applies
to the image's other dimensions. Consider a point like E
in figure \figref{curved-mirror-mag}. The trick is that out of all the rays
diffusely reflected by E, we pick the one that happens to
head for the mirror's center, C. The equal-angle property
of specular reflection plus a little straightforward
geometry easily leads us to the conclusion that triangles
ABC and CDE are the same shape, with ABC being simply a
scaled-up version of CDE. The magnification of depth equals
the ratio BC/CD, and the up-down magnification is AB/DE. A
repetition of the same proof shows that the magnification in
the third dimension (out of the page) is also the same. This
means that the image-head is simply a larger version of the
real one, without any distortion. The scaling factor is
called the magnification, $M$. The image in the figure is
magnified by a factor $M=1.9$.

Note that we did not explicitly specify whether the mirror
was a sphere, a paraboloid, or some other shape. However, we
assumed that a focused image would be formed, which would
not necessarily be true, for instance, for a mirror that was
asymmetric or very deeply curved.

\index{images!real}

If we start by placing an object very close to the mirror,
\subfigref{real-and-virtual}{1}, and then move it farther and farther away, the image at
first behaves as we would expect from our everyday
experience with flat mirrors, receding deeper and deeper
behind the mirror. At a certain point, however, a dramatic
change occurs. When the object is more than a certain
distance from the mirror, \subfigref{real-and-virtual}{2}, the image appears upside-down
and in \emph{front} of the mirror.

Here's what's happened. The mirror bends light rays inward,
but when the object is very close to it, as in \subfigref{real-and-virtual}{1}, the rays
coming from a given point on the object are too strongly
diverging (spreading) for the mirror to bring them back
together. On reflection, the rays are still diverging, just
not as strongly diverging. But when the object is sufficiently
far away, \subfigref{real-and-virtual}{2}, the mirror is only intercepting the rays that
came out in a narrow cone, and it is able to bend these
enough so that they will reconverge.

Note that the rays shown in the figure, which both
originated at the same point on the object, reunite when
they cross. The point where they cross is the image of the
point on the original object. This type of image is called a
\emph{real image}, in contradistinction to the virtual
images we've studied before. The use of the word ``real'' is
perhaps unfortunate. It sounds as though we are saying the
image was an actual material object, which of course it is not.

The distinction between a real image and a virtual image is
an important one, because a real image can be projected onto a
screen or photographic film. If a piece of paper is inserted
in figure \subfigref{real-and-virtual}{2} at the location of the image, the image will
be visible on the paper (provided the object is bright and
the room is dark). Your eye uses a lens to make a real image

If you are wearing glasses right now, then the light rays
from the page are being manipulated first by your glasses
and then by the lens of your eye. You might think that it
would be extremely difficult to analyze        this, but in fact it
is quite easy. In any series of optical elements (mirrors or
lenses or both), each element works on the rays furnished by
the previous element in exactly the same manner as if the
image formed by the previous element was an actual object.

Figure \figref{newtonian-telescope} shows an example involving only mirrors. The
Newtonian telescope, invented by Isaac \index{Newton, Isaac}
Newton, consists of a large curved mirror, plus a
second, flat mirror that brings the light out of the tube.
(In very large telescopes, there may be enough room to put a
camera or even a person inside the tube, in which case the
second mirror is not needed.) The tube of the telescope is
not vital; it is mainly a structural element, although it
can also be helpful for blocking out stray light. The lens
has been removed from the front of the camera body, and is
not needed for this setup. Note that the two sample rays
have been drawn parallel, because an astronomical telescope
is used for viewing objects that are extremely far away.
These two ``parallel'' lines actually meet at a certain
point, say a crater on the moon, so they can't actually be
perfectly parallel, but they are parallel for all practical
purposes since we would have to follow them upward for a
quarter of a million miles to get to the point where they intersect.

The large curved mirror by itself would form an image $\zu{I}$, but
the small flat mirror creates an image of the image, $\zu{I}'$. The
relationship between $\zu{I}$ and $\zu{I}'$ is exactly the same as it
would be if $\zu{I}$ was an actual object rather than an image: $\zu{I}$
and $\zu{I}'$ are at equal distances from the plane of the mirror,
and the line between them is perpendicular to the plane of the mirror.

One surprising wrinkle is that whereas a flat mirror used by
itself forms a virtual image of an object that is real, here
the mirror is forming a real image of virtual image $\zu{I}$. This
shows how pointless it would be to try to memorize lists of
facts about what kinds of images are formed by various
optical elements under various circumstances. You are better
off simply drawing a ray diagram.

Although the main point here was to give an example of an
image of an image, figure \figref{newtonian-telescope-eye} shows an interesting case where we
need to make the distinction between \emph{magnification}
and \emph{angular magnification}\index{angular magnification}\index{magnification!angular}.
$\zu{I}$f you are looking at the moon through this telescope, then
the images $\zu{I}$ and $\zu{I}'$ are much \emph{smaller} than the actual
moon. Otherwise, for example, image $\zu{I}$ would not fit inside
the telescope! However, these images are very close to your
eye compared to the actual moon. The small size of the image
has been more than compensated for by the shorter distance.
The important thing here is the amount of \emph{angle}
within your field of view that the image covers, and it is
this angle that has been increased. The factor by which it
is increased is called the \emph{angular magnification}, $M_a$.

<% begin_hw('convexraytracing') %>
In this chapter we've only done examples of mirrors with
hollowed-out shapes (called concave mirrors). Now draw a ray
diagram for a curved mirror that has a bulging outward shape
(called a convex mirror). (a) How does the image's distance
from the mirror compare with the actual object's distance
from the mirror? From this comparison, determine whether the
magnification is greater than or less than one. (b) Is the
image real or virtual? Could this mirror ever make the
other type of image?

A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is a device
that lets you figure out where you are by measuring the
time for radio signals to travel between you and the satellite, which is related to the
distance between you and the satellite. By finding the
ranges to several different satellites in this way, it can
pin down your location in three dimensions to within a few
meters. How accurate does the measurement of the time delay
have to be to determine your position to this accuracy?
