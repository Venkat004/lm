``Sure, and maybe the sun won't come up tomorrow.'' Of
course, the sun only appears to go up and down because the
earth spins, so the cliche should really refer to the
unlikelihood of the earth's stopping its rotation abruptly
during the night. Why can't it stop? It wouldn't violate
conservation of momentum, because the earth's rotation
doesn't add anything to its momentum. While California spins
in one direction, some equally massive part of India goes
the opposite way, canceling its momentum. A halt to Earth's
rotation would entail a drop in kinetic energy, but that
energy could simply be converted into some other form, such as heat.

Other examples along these lines are not hard to find. A
hydrogen atom spins at the same rate for billions of years.
A high-diver who is rotating when he comes off the board
does not need to make any physical effort to continue
rotating, and indeed would be unable to stop rotating
before he hit the water.

These observations have the hallmarks of a conservation law,
but what numerical measure of rotational motion is conserved?
Car engines and old-fashioned LP records have speeds of
rotation measured in rotations per minute (r.p.m.), but the
number of rotations per minute (or per second) is not a
conserved quantity. For example, the twirling figure skater in
figure \figref{figure-skater}
can pull her arms in to increase her r.p.m.'s.

The example of the figure skater suggests that this
conserved quantity depends on distance from the axis of
rotation. We'll notate this distance as $r$, since, for
an object moving in a circle around an axis of rotation,
its distance from the axis equals the radius of the
circle. 

Once we realize that $r$ is a variable that matters, it
becomes clear that the examples we've been considering were
all examples that would be fairly complicated mathematically,
because different parts of these objects' masses have different
values of $r$. For example, the figure skater's front teeth
are farther from the axis than her back teeth. That suggests that
instead of objects with complicated shapes, we should consider
the simplest possible example, which is a single particle, of
mass $m$, traveling in a circle of radius $r$ at speed $v$.
Experiments show that the conserved quantity in this situation
is
\begin{equation*}
  \pm mvr\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
We call this quantity \emph{angular momentum}.\index{angular momentum}
The symbol $\pm$ indicates that angular momentum has a positive or
negative sign to represent the direction of rotation; for example,
in a given problem, we could choose to represent clockwise angular
momenta as positive numbers, and counterclockwise ones as negative.
In this equation, the only velocity that matters is velocity that
is perpendicular to the radius line; motion parallel to the radius line,
i.e., directly in our out, is neither clockwise nor counterclockwise.

\begin{eg}{A figure skater pulls her arms in}
When the skater in figure \figref{figure-skater}
pulls her arms in, she is decreasing $r$ for all the atoms
in her arms. It would violate conservation of angular
momentum if she then continued rotating at the same speed,
i.e., taking the same amount of time for each revolution, because
her arms would be closer to the axis of rotation and therefore
have a smaller $r$ (as well as a smaller $v$ because they would
be completing a smaller circle in the same time).
This is impossible because it would
violate conservation of angular momentum. If her total
angular momentum is to remain constant, the decrease in angular momentum
for her arms must be compensated for by an overall increase
in her rate of rotation. That is, by pulling her arms in,
she substantially reduces the time for each rotation.

In figure \figref{longjump},
the jumper wants to get his feet out in front of
him so he can keep from doing a ``face plant'' when he
lands. Bringing his feet forward would involve a certain
quantity of counterclockwise rotation, but he didn't start
out with any rotation when he left the ground. Suppose we
consider counterclockwise as positive and clockwise as
negative. The only way his legs can acquire some positive
rotation is if some other part of his body picks up an equal
amount of negative rotation. This is why he swings his arms
up behind him, clockwise.

\begin{eg}{Changing the axis}\label{eg:viola-at-frog}
An object's angular momentum can be different depending on
the axis about which it rotates, because $r$ is defined relative
to the axis. Figure \ref{fig:viola-at-frog}
shows two double-exposure photographs
a viola player tipping the bow in order to cross from one
string to another. Much more angular momentum is required
when playing near the bow's handle, called the frog, as
in the panel on the right; not only are most
of the atoms in the bow are at greater distances, $r$,
from the axis of rotation, but the ones in the tip also
have more velocity, $v$. It is difficult for the player to
quickly transfer a large angular momentum into the bow, and then
transfer it back out just as quickly. This is one of the reasons
that string players tend to stay near the middle of the bow
as much as possible.

\begin{eg}{Kepler's equal-area law}\label{eg:equal-area-angular-momentum}
The hypothetical planet in figure \figref{equal-area-angular-momentum} has an orbit
in which its closest approach to the sun is at half the distance compared to the
point at which it recedes the farthest. Since angular momentum, $mvr$, is conserved,
and the planet's mass is constant,
the quantity $vr$ must be the same at both ends of the orbit. Doubling $r$ therefore
requires cutting $v$ in half. If the time interval from A to B is the same as that
from C to D, then the distance from C to D must be half as much.
But this is exactly what Kepler's equal area law requires, since the triangular pie
wedge on top needs to have half the width to compensate for its doubled height.
In other words, the equal area law is a direct consequence of conservation of angular
momentum.

\startdq

\begin{dq}
Conservation of plain old momentum, $p$, can be thought of
as the greatly expanded and modified descendant of Galileo's
original principle of inertia, that no force is required to
keep an object in motion. The principle of inertia is
counterintuitive, and there are many situations in which it
appears superficially that a force \emph{is} needed to
maintain motion, as maintained by Aristotle. Think of a
situation in which conservation of angular momentum, $L$,
also seems to be violated, making it seem incorrectly that
something external must act on a closed system to keep its
angular momentum from ``running down.''

\begin{dq}\label{dq:conical-pendulum}
The figure is a strobe photo of a pendulum bob,
taken from underneath the pendulum looking straight up. The
black string can't be seen in the photograph. The bob was
given a slight sideways push when it was released, so it did
not swing in a plane. The bright spot marks the center, i.e.,
the position the bob would have if it hung straight down at
us. Does the bob's angular momentum appear to remain
constant if we consider the center to be the axis of
rotation? What if we choose a different axis?

Force is the rate of transfer of
momentum. The equivalent in the case of angular momentum is
called \emph{torque}\index{torque!defined} (rhymes with
``fork''):
\begin{equation*}
  \text{torque} = \frac{\text{amount of angular momentum transferred}}{\text{time taken to transfer it}}
\end{equation*}
 Where force tells us how hard we are pushing or
pulling on something, torque indicates how hard we are
twisting on it.

    %q{The boy makes a torque on the tetherball.}

%>
<% end_marg %>


Have you ever had the experience of trying to open a door by
pushing on the wrong side, the side near the hinge? It's
difficult to do, which apparently indicates that a given
amount of force produces less torque when it's applied close
to the axis of rotation. To try to pin down this relationship
more precisely, let's imagine hitting a tetherball, \figref{tetherball}.
The boy applies a force $F$ to the ball for a short time $t$, accelerating
the ball from rest to a velocity $v$. Since force is the rate of transfer of
momentum, we have
\begin{align*}
  F & = \frac{mv}{t}\eqquad, \\
\intertext{and multiplying both sides by $r$ gives}  
  Fr & = \frac{mvr}{t}\eqquad. \\
\end{align*}
But $\pm mvr$ is simply the amount of angular momentum he's given
the ball, so $\pm mvr/t$ also equals the amount of torque he applied. The result
of this example is
\begin{equation*}
  \text{torque} = \pm Fr\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where the plus or minus sign indicates whether torque would tend to create
clockwise or counterclockwise motion.
This equation applies more generally, with the caveat that $F$ should only
include the part of the force perpendicular to the radius line.

To summarize, we've learned three conserved quantity, each of which has
a rate of transfer:

<% begin_sec("Torque distinguished from force") %>

Of course a force is necessary in order to create a torque
--- you can't twist a screw without pushing on the wrench
--- but force and torque are two different things. One
distinction between them is direction. We use positive and
negative signs to represent forces in the two possible
directions along a line. The direction of a torque, however,
is clockwise or counterclockwise, not a linear direction.

The other difference between torque and force is a matter of
leverage. A given force applied at a door's knob will change
the door's angular momentum twice as rapidly as the same
force applied halfway between the knob and the hinge. The
same amount of force produces different amounts of
torque in these two cases.

      The plane's four engines produce zero
      total torque but not zero total force.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

It is possible to have a zero total torque with a nonzero
total force. An airplane with four jet engines, \figref{airplane}, would be
designed so that their forces are balanced on the left and
right. Their forces are all in the same direction, but the
clockwise torques of two of the engines are canceled by the
counterclockwise torques of the other two, giving zero total torque.

Conversely, we can have zero total force and nonzero total
torque. A merry-go-round's engine needs to supply a nonzero
torque on it to bring it up to speed, but there is zero
total force on it. If there was not zero total force on it,
its center of mass would accelerate!

\begin{eg}{A lever}\label{eg:biceps}
Figure \figref{biceps} shows an example of
a lever within your arm. Different muscles are used to flex
and extend the arm, because muscles work only by contraction.
The biceps flexes it.

<% marg(0) %>
<%
  fig(
    'biceps',
    %q{Example \ref{eg:biceps}: the biceps muscle flexes the arm.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

There are
three forces acting on the forearm: the force from the
biceps, the force at the elbow joint, and the force from
the load being lifted.
Because the elbow joint is motionless, it is natural to
define our torques using the joint as the axis. The
situation now becomes quite simple, because the upper arm
bone's force exerted at the elbow has $r=0$, and therefore creates
no torque. We can ignore it completely. In general, we would
call this the fulcrum of the lever.

If we restrict ourselves to the case in which the forearm
rotates with constant angular momentum, then we know that
the total torque on the forearm is zero, so the torques
from the muscle and the load must be opposite in sign and
equal in absolute value:
\begin{equation*}
                r_{muscle} F_{muscle}  =  r_{load} F_{load}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $r_{muscle}$, the distance from the elbow joint to the
biceps' point of insertion on the forearm, is only a few cm,
while $r_{load}$ might be 30 cm or so. The force exerted by
the muscle must therefore be about ten times the force
exerted by the load. We thus see that this lever is a force
reducer. In general, a lever may be used either to increase
or to reduce a force.

Why did our arms evolve so as to reduce force? In general,
your body is built for compactness and maximum speed of
motion rather than maximum force. This is the main
anatomical difference between us and the \index{Neanderthals}Neanderthals
(their brains covered the same range of sizes as those of
modern humans), and it seems to have worked for us.

As with all machines, the lever is incapable of changing the
amount of mechanical work we can do. A lever that increases
force will always reduce motion, and vice versa, leaving the
amount of work unchanged.

Suppose a sunless planet is sitting all by itself in interstellar space,
not rotating. Then, one day, it decides to start spinning. This doesn't
necessarily violate conservation of energy, because it could have energy
stored up, e.g., the heat in a molten core, which could be converted into
kinetic energy. It does violate conservation of angular momentum, but even
if we didn't already know about that law of physics, the story would seem
odd. How would it decide which axis to spin around? If it was to spontaneously
start spinning about some axis, then that axis would have to be a special,
preferred direction in space. That is, space itself would have to have
some asymmetry to it.

In reality, as I've already mentioned on page \pageref{rotational-symmetry},
experiments show to a very high degree of precision that the
laws of physics are completely symmetric with respect to different directions.
The story of the planet that abruptly starts spinning is an example of Noether's theorem,
applied to angular momentum. We now have three such examples:

\begin{noethertable}
time symmetry & \noetherimplies & mass-energy \\
translation symmetry & \noetherimplies & momentum \\
rotational symmetry & \noetherimplies & angular momentum \\
