Fantasy novelist T.H.~White invented a wonderful phrase that has since\index{Gell-Mann, Murray}
entered into popular culture: ``Everything not forbidden is compulsory.''
Originally intended as a satire of totalitarianism, it was taken up by 
physicist Murray Gell-Mann as a metaphor for physics. What he meant
was that the laws of physics forbid all the impossible things, and what's
left over is what really happens.
Conservation of mass and energy prevent many things from happening. Objects
can't disappear into thin air, and you can't run your car forever without
putting gas in it.

Some other processes are impossible, but not forbidden
by these two conservation laws. 
In the martial arts movie \emph{Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon},
those who have received mystical enlightenment are able to violate the
laws of physics. Some of the violation, such as their ability
to fly, are obvious, but others are a little more subtle. The rebellious young
heroine/antiheroine Jen Yu gets into an argument while sitting
at a table in a restaurant. A young tough, Iron Arm Lu, comes running toward her at full
speed, and she puts up one arm and effortlessly makes him bounce
back, without even getting out of her seat or bracing herself against
anything. She does all this between bites.
It's impossible, but how do we know it's impossible? It doesn't violate conservation
of mass, because neither character's mass changes. It conserves energy as well,
since the rebounding Lu has the same energy he started with.\label{tiger}

Suppose you live in a country where the only laws are prohibitions against
murder and robbery. One day someone covers your house with graffiti, and the
authorities refuse to prosecute, because no crime was committed. You're
convinced of the need for a new law against vandalism. Similarly, the story of
Jen Yu and Iron Arm Lu shows that we need a new conservation law.

<% begin_sec("Translation Symmetry",0,'translation-symmetry') %>\index{symmetry!translation}
The most fundamental laws of physics are conservation laws, and Noether's theorem
tells us that conservation laws are the way they are because of symmetry. Time
symmetry is responsible for conservation of energy, but time is like a
river with only two directions, past and future. What's impossible about Lu's
motion is the abrupt reversal in the direction of his motion in \emph{space}, but neither
time symmetry nor energy conservation tell us anything about directions
in space. When you put gas in your car, you don't have to decide whether you want to
buy north gas or south gas, east, west, up or down gas. Energy has no direction. What
we need is a new conserved quantity that has a direction in space, and such a
conservation law can only come from a symmetry that relates to space. Since we've already
had some luck with time symmetry, which says that the laws of physics are the same at all
times, it seems reasonable to turn now to the possibility of a new type of symmetry,
which would state that the laws of physics are the same in all places in space.
This is known as translation symmetry, where the word ``translation'' is being
used in a mathematical sense that means sliding something around without rotating it.

\label{points-in-space-have-no-identity}
Translation symmetry would seem reasonable to most people, but you'll see that it
ends up producing some very surprising results. To see how, it will be
helpful to imagine the consequences of a violation of translation symmetry.
What if, like the laws of nations, the laws of physics were different in different
places? What would happen, and how would we detect it? We could try doing the
same experiment in two different places and comparing the results, but it's
even easier than that. Tap your finger on this spot on the page
\begin{equation*}
        \times
\end{equation*}
and then wait a second and do it again. Did both taps occur at the same point in space?
You're probably thinking that's a silly question; am I just checking whether you followed
my directions? Not at all. Consider the whole scene from the point of view of a Martian
who is observing it through a powerful telescope from her home planet. (You didn't
draw the curtains, did you?) From her point of view, the earth is spinning
on its axis and orbiting the sun, at speeds measured in thousands of kilometers per hour.
According to her, your second finger tap happened at a point in space about
30 kilometers from the first. If you want to impress the Martians and win the Martian version of
the Nobel Prize for detecting a violation of translation symmetry,
all you have to do is perform a physics experiment twice in the same laboratory, and
show that the result is different.

But who's to say that the Martian point of view is the right one? It gets a little thorny
now. How do you know that what you detected was a violation of translation symmetry
at all? Maybe it was just a violation of time symmetry. The Martian Nobel
committee isn't going to give you the prize based on an experiment this ambiguous. A
possible scheme for resolving the ambiguity would be to wait a year and do the same
experiment a third time. After a year, the earth will have completed one full orbit around the
sun, and your lab will be back in the same spot in space. If the third experiment comes out
the same as the first one, then you can make a strong argument that what you've detected is
an asymmetry of space, not time. There's a problem, however. You and the Martians agree
that the earth is back in the same place after a year, but what about an observer from
another solar system, whose planet orbits a different star? This observer says that our
whole solar system is in motion. To him, the earth's motion around our sun looks like a spiral or a
corkscrew, since the sun is itself moving.

This story shows that translation symmetry is closely related to the relative nature
of motion, as expressed by the principle of inertia. Riding in a train on a long, straight track at constant speed, how can you even
tell you're in motion? You can look at the scenery outside, but that's irrelevant, because
we could argue that the trees and cows are moving while you stand still. (The Martians
say both train and scenery are moving.) The real point is whether you can
detect your motion without reference to any external object. You can hear the repetitive
thunk-thunk-thunk as the train passes from one piece of track to the next, but again
this is just a reference to an external object --- all that proves is that you're moving
relative to the tracks, but is there any way to tell that you're moving in some
\emph{absolute} sense? Assuming no interaction with the outside world, 
is there any experiment you can do that will give a different result
when the train is in motion than when it's at rest?
You could if translation symmetry was violated. If the laws of physics were different
in different places, then as the train moved it would pass through them. ``Riding over''
these regions would be like riding over the pieces of track, but you would be able
to detect the transition from one region to the next simply because experiments inside
the train came out different, without referring to any external objects.
Rather than the thunk-thunk-thunk of the rails, you would
detect increases and decreases in some quantity such as the gravitational constant $G$,
or the speed of light, or the mass of the electron.

We can therefore conclude that the following two hypotheses are closely related.

\begin{important}[The principle of inertia]
The results of experiments don't depend on the straight-line,
constant-speed motion of the apparatus. 
\end{important}

\begin{important}[Translation symmetry]
The laws of physics are the same at every point in space. Specifically, experiments
don't give different results just because you set up your apparatus in a different place.
\end{important}

\begin{eg}{A state of absolute rest}\label{eg:absoluterest}
Suppose that translation symmetry is violated. The laws of phys\-ics are different
in one region of space than in another. Cruising in our spaceship, we monitor the
fluctuations in the laws of physics by watching the needle on a meter that measures
some fundamental quantity such as the gravitational constant. We make a short blast
with the ship's engines and turn them off again. Now we see that the needle is wavering
more slowly, so evidently it's taking us more time to move from one region to the next.
We keep on blasting with the ship's engines until the fluctuations stop entirely. Now
we know that we're in a state of absolute rest. The violation of translation
symmetry logically resulted in a violation of the principle of inertia.
\end{eg}

Let's return to the impossible story of Jen Yu and Iron Arm Lu on page \pageref{tiger}.
For simplicity, we'll model them as two identical, featureless pool balls,
\figref{impossible-a}. This may seem like a drastic simplification, but even a collision
between two human bodies is really just a series of many collisions between atoms.
The film shows a series of instants in time, viewed from overhead. The light-colored ball comes in, hits the
darker ball, and rebounds. It seems strange that the dark ball has such a big
effect on the light ball without experiencing any consequences itself, but how can we show that
this is really impossible?

<%
  fig(
    'impossible-a',
    %q{%
        How can we prove that this collision is impossible?
    },
    {
      'width'=>'wide',
      'sidecaption'=>true
    }
  )
%>

We can show it's impossible by looking at it in a different frame of reference,
\figref{impossible-b}. This camera follows the light ball on its way in, so in this
frame the incoming light ball appears motionless. (If you ever get hauled into court
on an assault charge for hitting someone, try this defense: ``Your honor, in my fist's
frame of reference, it was his face that assaulted my knuckles!'') After the collision,
we let the camera keep moving in the same direction, because if we didn't, it wouldn't be
showing us an inertial frame of reference. To help convince yourself that figures
\figref{impossible-a} and \figref{impossible-b} represent the same motion seen in two
different frames, note that both films agree on the distances between the balls at
each instant. After the collision, frame \figref{impossible-b} shows the light ball moving twice as fast as the dark
ball; an observer who prefers frame \figref{impossible-a} explains this
by saying that the camera that produced film \figref{impossible-b} was moving one
way, while the ball was moving the opposite way.

<%
  fig(
    'impossible-b',
    %q{%
      The collision of figure \figref{impossible-a} is viewed in a different frame of reference.
    },
    {
      'width'=>'wide',
      'sidecaption'=>true
    }
  )
%>

Figures \figref{impossible-a} and \figref{impossible-b} record the same
events, so if one is impossible, the other is too. But figure \figref{impossible-b}
is definitely impossible, because it violates conservation of energy. Before
the collision, the only kinetic energy is the dark ball's. After the collision, light
ball suddenly has some energy, but where did that energy come from? It can only have
come from the dark ball. The dark ball should then have lost some energy, which it hasn't,
since it's moving at the same speed as before.

Figure \figref{possible} shows what really does happen. This kind of behavior is
familiar to anyone who plays pool. In a head-on collision, the incoming ball stops
dead, and the target ball takes all its energy and flies away. In \subfigref{possible}{1},
the light ball hits the dark ball. In \subfigref{possible}{2}, the camera is initially following
the light ball; in this frame of reference, the dark ball hits the light one (``Judge,
his face hit my knuckles!''). The frame of reference shown in
\subfigref{possible}{3} is particularly interesting. Here the
camera always stays at the midpoint between the two balls. This is called the
center-of-mass frame of reference.

<%
  fig(
    'possible',
    %q{%
       This is what really happens. Three films represent the same
       collision viewed in three different frames of reference. Energy is conserved in
       all three frames. Figure \figref{collision-x-t} shows a less cumbersome way of
       representing the same thing.

an inertial frame of reference?

  ) %>


What's special about the center-of-mass frame is its symmetry. In this frame, both balls
have the same initial speed. Since they start out with the same speed, and they have the
same mass, there's no reason for them to behave differently from each other after the collision.
By symmetry, if the light ball feels a certain effect from the dark ball, the dark ball must feel
the same effect from the light ball. 

This is exactly like the rules of accounting. Let's say two big corporations are
doing business with each other. If Glutcorp pays a million dollars to Slushco,
two things happen: Glutcorp's bank account goes down by a million dollars, and
Slushco's rises by the same amount. The two companies' books have to show
transactions on the same date that are equal in size, but one is positive
(a payment) and one is negative. What if Glutcorp records $-1,000,000$ dollars,
but Slushco's books say $+920,000$? This indicates that a law has been broken;
the accountants are going to call the police and start looking for the employee who's
driving a new 80,000-dollar Jaguar. Money is supposed to be conserved.

is toward the top of the page. In figure \subfigref{possible}{1}

Accounting works because money is conserved. Apparently, something is also conserved when
the balls collide. We call it momentum. Momentum is not the same as velocity, because
conserved quantities have to be additive. Our pool balls are like identical atoms, but
atoms can be stuck together to form molecules, people, and planets. Because conservation
laws work by addition, two atoms stuck together and moving at a certain velocity must have
double the momentum that a single atom would have had. We therefore define momentum as
velocity multiplied by mass.\index{Noether's theorem!for momentum}

\begin{important}[Conservation of momentum]
The quantity defined by
$        \text{momentum} = mv$
is conserved.
\end{important}

This is our second example of Noether's theorem:\nopagebreak

\begin{noethertable}
time symmetry & \noetherimplies & mass-energy \\
translation symmetry & \noetherimplies & momentum \\
\end{noethertable}

\begin{eg}{Conservation of momentum for pool balls}
\egquestion
Is momentum conserved in figure \subfigref{possible}{1}?

\eganswer
We have to check whether the total initial momentum is the same as the total
final momentum.
\begin{multline*}
        \text{dark ball's initial momentum} + \text{light ball's initial momentum}\\
        =? \\
       \text{dark ball's final momentum} + \text{light ball's final momentum}
\end{multline*}
Yes, momentum was conserved:
\begin{equation*}
        0+mv = mv+0
\end{equation*}
\end{eg}

<% marg(0) %>
<%
  fig(
    'skaters',

%>  
<% end_marg %>

\begin{eg}{Ice skaters push off from each other}\label{eg:skatersmomentum}
If the ice skaters in figure \figref{skaters} have equal masses,
then left-right (mirror) symmetry implies that they moved off with equal speeds
in opposite directions. Let's check that this is consistent with conservation
of momentum:
\begin{multline*}
        \text{left skater's initial momentum} + \text{right skater's initial momentum}\\
        =? \\
       \text{left skater's final momentum} + \text{right skater's final momentum}
\end{multline*}
Momentum was conserved:
\begin{equation*}
        0+0 = m\times(-v)+mv
\end{equation*}
This is an interesting example, because if these had been pool balls instead
of people, we would have accused them of violating conservation of energy. Initially
there was zero kinetic energy, and at the end there wasn't zero. (Note that the energies
at the end don't cancel, because kinetic energy is always positive, regardless
of direction.) The mystery is resolved because they're people, not pool balls. They
both ate food, and they therefore have chemical energy inside their bodies:
\begin{equation*}
        \text{food energy} \rightarrow \text{kinetic energy} + \text{kinetic energy} + \text{heat}
\end{equation*}
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Unequal masses}
\egquestion Suppose the skaters have unequal masses: 50 kg for the one on the left, and 55 kg for
the other. The more massive skater, on the right, moves off at 1.0 m/s. How fast does
the less massive skater go?

\eganswer Their momenta (plural of momentum) have to be the same amount, but with opposite signs.
The less massive skater  must have a greater velocity if her momentum is going to be
as much as the more massive one's.
\begin{align*}
        0+0 &= (50\ \kgunit)(-v)+(55\ \kgunit)(1.0\ \munit/\sunit)\\
        (50\ \kgunit)(v) &= (55\ \kgunit)(1.0\ \munit/\sunit)\\
        v &= \frac{(55\ \kgunit)}{50\ \kgunit}(1.0\ \munit/\sunit)\\
          &= 1.1\ \munit/\sunit
\end{align*}

Momentum and kinetic energy are both measures of the
amount of motion, and a sideshow in the Newton-Leibniz
controversy over who invented calculus was an argument over
which quantity was the ``true'' measure of
motion. The modern student can certainly be excused for
wondering why we need both quantities, when their complementary
nature was not evident to the greatest minds of the 1700's.
The following table highlights their differences.

\noindent\begin{tabular}{|p{52mm}|p{52mm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Kinetic energy\ldots}        & \textbf{Momentum\ldots}\\
\hline
has no direction in space. & has a direction in space.\\

is always positive, and cannot cancel out. & cancels with momentum in the opposite direction.\\
\hline

a conserved quantity by itself. & is always conserved.\\
\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}


Here are some examples that show the different behaviors
of the two quantities.

\begin{eg}{A spinning coin}\label{eg:coinmomentum}
A spinning coin has zero total momentum, because for every
moving point, there is another point on the opposite side
that cancels its momentum. It does, however, have kinetic energy.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Momentum and kinetic energy in firing a rifle}
The rifle and bullet have zero momentum and zero kinetic
energy to start with. When the trigger is pulled, the bullet
gains some momentum in the forward direction, but this is
canceled by the rifle's backward momentum, so the total
momentum is still zero. The kinetic energies of the gun and
bullet are both positive numbers, however, and do not
cancel. The total kinetic energy is allowed to increase,
because both objects' kinetic energies are destined to be
dissipated as heat --- the gun's ``backward'' kinetic energy
does not refrigerate the shooter's shoulder!
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{The wobbly earth}
As the moon completes half a circle around the earth, its
motion reverses direction. This does not involve any change
in kinetic energy, because the moon doesn't speed up or slow
down, nor is there any change in gravitational energy, because
the moon stays at the same distance from the earth.\footnote{Actually these
statements are both only approximately true. The moon's orbit isn't exactly a circle.}
 The reversed velocity 
does, however, imply a reversed momentum, so
conservation of momentum 
tells us that the earth must also change its momentum. In
fact, the earth wobbles in a little ``orbit'' about a point
below its surface on the line connecting it and the moon.
The two bodies' momenta always point in opposite
directions and cancel each other out.

\begin{eg}{The earth and moon get a divorce}\label{eg:earthmoondivorce}
Why can't the moon suddenly decide to fly off one way and
the earth the other way? It is not forbidden by conservation
of momentum, because the moon's newly acquired momentum in
one direction could be canceled out by the change in the
momentum of the earth, supposing the earth headed the
opposite direction at the appropriate, slower speed. The
catastrophe is forbidden by conservation of energy, because
both their kinetic energies would have increased greatly.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Momentum and kinetic energy of a glacier}
A cubic-kilometer glacier would have a mass of about
$10^{12}$  kg --- 1 followed by 12 zeroes. If it moves at a speed of $0.00001$  m/s,
then its momentum would be $10,000,000\ \kgunit\unitdot\munit/\sunit$. 
This is the kind of
heroic-scale result we expect, perhaps the equivalent of the
space shuttle taking off, or all the cars in LA driving in
the same direction at freeway speed. Its kinetic energy,
however, is only 50 joules, the equivalent of the calories
contained in a poppy seed or the energy in a drop of
gasoline too small to be seen without a microscope. The
surprisingly small kinetic energy is because kinetic energy
is proportional to the square of the velocity, and the
square of a small number is an even smaller number.

definition is known as Newton's second law of motion. Don't memorize that!} The metric
unit of force is the newton (N).\index{force!unit}\index{newton (unit)}
The relationship between force and momentum is like the relationship between
power and energy, or the one between your cash flow and your bank balance:

\egquestion A bullet emerges from a gun with a momentum of 1.0 $\kgunit\unitdot\munit/\sunit$, after
having been acted on for 0.01 seconds by the force of the gases from the explosion of the gunpowder.
What was the force on the bullet?

\eganswer 
The force is\footnote{This is really only an estimate of the average force over the time it takes for the bullet
to move down the barrel. The force probably starts out stronger than this, and then gets weaker because the gases
expand and cool.}
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{1.0}{0.01} = 100\ \text{newtons} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
\end{eg}

There's no new physics happening here, just a definition of the word ``force.'' Definitions are neither right nor
wrong, and just because the Chinese call it \raisebox{-0.2mm}{\anonymousinlinefig{li}} instead, that doesn't mean they're
incorrect. But when Isaac Newton first started using the term ``force'' according to this
technical definition, people already had some definite ideas about what the word meant.

In some cases Newton's definition matches our intuition. In example \ref{eg:bulletforce}, we divided by a small
time, and the result was a big force; this is intuitively reasonable, since we expect the force on the bullet to
be strong.

In other situations, however, our intuition rebels against reality.

\begin{eg}{Extra protein}\label{eg:extraprotein}
\egquestion
While riding my bike fast down a steep hill, I pass through a cloud of gnats, and one of them goes into my
mouth. Compare my force on the gnat to the gnat's force on me.

\eganswer
Momentum is conserved, so the momentum gained by the gnat equals the momentum lost by me. Momentum
conservation holds true at every instant over the fraction of a second that it takes for the collision to
happen. The rate of transfer
of momentum out of me must equal the rate of transfer into the gnat. Our forces on each other have the
same strength, but they're in opposite directions.

\noindent Most people would be willing to believe that the momentum gained by the gnat is the same as the
momentum lost by me, but they would not believe that the forces are the same strength. Nevertheless, 
the second statement follows from the first merely as a matter of definition. 
Whenever two objects, A and B, interact,\label{thirdlaw}
A's force on B is the same strength as B's force on A, and the forces are in opposite directions.\footnote{This
is called Newton's third law. Don't memorize that name!}
\begin{equation*}
        \text{(A on B)} = -\text{(B on A)}

Using the metaphor of money, suppose Alice and Bob are adrift in a life raft, and pass the time by playing
poker. Money is conserved, so if they count all the money in the boat every night, they should always come
up with the same total. A completely equivalent statement is that their cash flows are equal and opposite.
If Alice is winning five dollars per hour, then Bob must be losing at the same rate.

This statement about equal forces in opposite directions implies to many students a kind of mystical
principle of equilibrium that explains why things don't move. That would be a useless principle, since it
would be violated every time something moved.\footnote{During the Scopes monkey trial, William Jennings Bryan
claimed that every time he picked his foot up off the ground, he was violating the law of gravity.} The ice skaters
of figure \figref{skaters} on page \pageref{fig:skaters} make forces on each
other, and their forces are equal in strength and opposite in direction. That doesn't mean
they won't move. They'll both move --- in opposite directions.

The fallacy comes from trying to
add things that it doesn't make sense to add, as suggested by the cartoon in figure \figref{cartoon-bar-tab}.
We only add forces that are acting on the same object. It doesn't make sense to say that the skaters'
forces on each other add up to zero, because it doesn't make sense to add them. One is a force on the
left-hand skater, and the other is a force on the right-hand skater.

In figure \figref{squeezescale}, my fingers'
force and my thumbs' force are both acting on the bathroom scale.
It does make sense to add these forces, and they may possibly add up to zero, but
that's not guaranteed by the laws of physics. 
If I throw the scale at you, my thumbs' force is stronger that my fingers', and the forces no longer cancel:
\begin{equation*}
        \text{(fingers on scale)} \ne -\text{(thumbs on scale)} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
What's guaranteed by conservation of momentum is a whole different relationship:
\begin{align*}
        \text{(fingers on scale)} &= -\text{(scale on fingers)} \\
        \text{(thumbs on scale)} &= -\text{(scale on thumbs)} \\

How much force does gravity make on an object? From everyday experience, we know
that this force is proportional to the object's mass.\footnote{This follows from the
additivity of forces.} Let's find the force on
a one-kilogram object. If we release this object from rest, then after it has
fallen one meter, its kinetic energy equals the strength of the gravitational field,
\begin{equation*}
10\ \text{joules per kilogram per meter}\times1\ \text{kilogram}\times1\ \text{meter} = 10\ \text{joules} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
Using the equation for kinetic energy and doing a little simple algebra, we find that
its final velocity is 4.4 m/s. It starts from 0 m/s, and ends at 4.4 m/s, so
its average velocity is 2.2 m/s, and the time takes to fall one meter is therefore
(1 m)/(2.2 m/s)=0.44 seconds. Its final momentum is 4.4 units, so the force on it was
evidently
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{4.4}{0.44} = 10\ \text{newtons} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
This is like one of those card tricks where the magician makes you go through a bunch
of steps so that you end up revealing the card you had chosen --- the result is just
equal to the gravitational field, 10, but in units of newtons! If algebra makes you feel
warm and fuzzy, you may want to replay the derivation using symbols and convince yourself
that it had to come out that way. If not, then I hope the numerical result is enough
to convince you of the general fact that the force of gravity on a one-kilogram mass
equals $g$. For masses other than one kilogram, we have the handy-dandy result that
\begin{equation*}
        (\text{force of gravity on a mass $m$}) = mg \qquad .
\end{equation*}
In other words, $g$ can be interpreted not just as the gravitational energy per kilogram
per meter of height, but also as the gravitational force per kilogram.

Galileo was an innovator in more than one way. He was arguably the inventor of open-source
software: he invented a mechanical calculating device for certain engineering applications,
and rather than keeping the device's design secret as his competitors did, he made it
public, but charged students for lessons in how to use it. Not only that, but he was
the first physicist to make money as a military consultant. Galileo understood projectiles
better than anyone else, because he understood the principle of inertia. Even if you're not
planning on a career involving artillery, projectile motion is a good thing to learn about
because it's an example of how to handle motion in two or three dimensions. \index{Galileo!projectile motion}\index{projectile motion}


Figure \figref{dropball} shows a ball in the process of falling --- or rising,
it really doesn't matter which. Let's say the ball has a mass of one kilogram, each square in
the grid is 10 meters on a side, and the positions of the ball are shown at time intervals
of one second. The earth's gravitational force on the ball is 10 newtons, so with each
second, the ball's momentum increases by 10 units, and its speed also increases by
10 m/s. The ball falls 10 m in the first second, 20 m in the next second, and so on.

Now let's look at the ball's motion in a new frame of reference, \figref{parabolaball},
which is moving at 10 meters per second to the left compared to the frame of reference
used in figure \figref{dropball}. An observer in this frame of reference sees the ball
as moving to the right by 10 meters every second. The ball traces an arc of a specific
mathematical type called a parabola:\index{parabola}

\hspace{15mm}\parbox{80mm}{\begin{tabular}{p{60mm}}
1 step over and 1 step down\\
1 step over and 2 steps down\\
1 step over and 3 steps down\\
1 step over and 4 steps down\\
\ldots
\end{tabular}}

It doesn't matter which frame of reference is the ``real'' one. Both diagrams
show the possible motion of a projectile. The interesting point here is that the vertical
force of gravity has no effect on the horizontal motion, and the horizontal motion also
has no effect on what happens in the vertical motion. The two are completely independent.
If the sun is directly overhead, the motion of the ball's shadow on the ground seems perfectly
natural: there are no horizontal forces, so it either sits still or moves at constant
velocity. (Zero force means zero rate of transfer of momentum.) The same is true if we shine
a light from one side and cast the ball's shadow on the wall. Both shadows obey the laws
of physics.

\begin{eg}{The moon}\label{eg:moonorbit}
In example \ref{eg:newtonsapple} on page \pageref{eg:newtonsapple}, I promised an
explanation of how Newton knew that the gravitational field experienced by the moon
due to the earth was 1/3600 of the one we feel here on the earth's surface.
The radius of the moon's orbit had been known since ancient times,
so Newton knew its speed to be 1,100 m/s (expressed in modern units).
If the earth's gravity wasn't acting on the moon, the moon would fly off straight,
along the straight line shown in figure \figref{moonorbit}, and it
would cover 1,100 meters in one second. We observe instead
that it travels the arc of a circle centered on the earth. Straightforward
geometry shows that the amount by which the arc drops below the straight line
is 1.6 millimeters. Near the surface of the earth, an object falls 5 meters
in one second,\footnote{Its initial speed is 0, and its final speed is 10 m/s, so its
average speed is 5 m/s over the first second of falling.} which is
indeed about 3600 times greater than 1.6 millimeters.

The tricky part about this argument is that although I said the path of a projectile
was a parabola, in this example it's a circle. What's going on here? What's different
here is that as the moon moves 1,100 meters, it changes its position relative to the
earth, so down is now in a new direction. We'll discuss circular motion more
carefully soon, but in this example, it really doesn't matter. The curvature of the
arc is so gentle that a parabola and a circle would appear almost identical. (Actually
the curvature is so gentle --- 1.6 millimeters over a distance of 1,100 meters! --- that
if I had drawn the figure to scale, you wouldn't have even been able to tell that it
wasn't straight.)\index{moon!orbit}

As an interesting historical note, Newton claimed that he first did this
calculation while confined to his family's farm during the plague of 1666, and
found the results to ``answer pretty nearly.''
His notebooks, however, show that although he did the calculation on that date,
the result didn't quite come out quite right, and he became uncertain about
whether his theory of gravity was correct as it stood or needed to be modified.
Not until 1675 did he learn of more accurate astronomical data, which convinced
him that his theory didn't need to be tinkered with.
It appears that he rewrote his own life story a little bit
in order to make it appear that his work was more advanced at an earlier
date, which would have helped him in his dispute with Leibniz over priority
in the invention of calculus.

There's another useful way of thinking about motion
along a curve.
In the absence of a force, an
object will continue moving in the same speed and in the same direction. One of my students
invented a wonderful phrase for this: the memory of motion. 
Over the first second of its motion, the ball in figure
\figref{memoryofmotion} moved 1 square over and 1 square down, which is 10 meters and
10 meters. The default for the next one-second
interval would be to repeat this, ending up at the location marked with the 
first dashed circle. The earth's 10-newton gravitational force on the ball, however, changes
the vertical part of the ball's momentum by 10 units. The ball actually ends up 10 meters
(1 square) below the default.

<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("Circular motion") %>\index{circular motion}
Figure \figref{hammer-polygons} shows how to apply the memory-of-motion idea to circular motion. It
should convince you that only an inward force is needed to produce circular motion.
One of the reasons Newton was the first to make any progress in analyzing the motion of
the planets around the sun was that his contemporaries were confused on this point. Most
of them thought that in addition to an attraction from the sun, a second, forward force
must exist on the planets, to keep them from slowing down. This is incorrect Aristotelian
thinking; objects don't naturally slow down. Car 1 in figure \figref{car-in-circle} only
needs a forward force in order to cancel out the backward force of friction; the total force on
it is zero. Similarly, the forward and backward forces on car 2 are canceling out, and the
only force left over is the inward one. There's no friction in the vacuum of outer space,
so if car 2 was a planet, the backward force wouldn't exist; the forward force wouldn't
exist either, because the only force would be the force of the sun's gravity.

One confusing thing about circular motion is that it often tempts us psychologically to adopt a
noninertial frame of reference. Figure \figref{pickup-truck-circular} shows a bowling ball in
the back of a turning pickup truck. Each panel gives a view of the same events from a different
frame of reference.
The frame of reference \subfigref{pickup-truck-circular}{1}, attached to the turning truck, is noninertial, because 
it changes the direction of its motion. The ball violates conservation of energy
by accelerating from rest for no apparent reason. Is there some mysterious outward force
that is slamming the ball into the side of the truck's bed? No. By analyzing everything in
a proper inertial frame of reference, \subfigref{pickup-truck-circular}{2}, we see that it's
the truck that swerves and hits the ball. That makes sense, because the truck is interacting
with the asphalt.\index{frame of reference!noninertial}

Isaac Newton's greatest triumph was his explanation of the motion of the planets
in terms of universal physical laws. It was a tremendous psychological revolution:
for the first time, both heaven and earth were seen as operating automatically
according to the same rules.

Newton wouldn't have been able to figure out \emph{why} the
planets move the way they do if it hadn't been for the
astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601)\index{Brahe, Tycho} and his protege Johannes
\index{Kepler, Johannes}Kepler (1571-1630), who together came up with
the first simple and accurate description of \emph{how} the
planets actually do move. The difficulty of their task is
suggested by figure \figref{retrograde}, which shows how the
relatively simple orbital motions of the earth and Mars
combine so that as seen from earth Mars appears to be
staggering in loops like a drunken sailor.

Brahe, the last of the great naked-eye astronomers,
collected extensive data on the motions of the planets over
a period of many years, taking the giant step from the
previous observations' accuracy of about 10 minutes of arc
(10/60 of a degree) to an unprecedented 1 minute. The
quality of his work is all the more remarkable considering
that his observatory consisted of four giant brass
protractors mounted upright in his castle in Denmark. Four
different observers would simultaneously measure the
position of a planet in order to check for mistakes and
reduce random errors.

      that appeared in the skies in 1572 was
      far beyond the Earth's atmosphere.
      This, along with Galileo's discovery of
      sunspots, showed that contrary to Aristotle, the heavens were not perfect
      and unchanging. Brahe's fame as an
      astronomer brought him patronage
      from King Frederick II, allowing him to
      carry out his historic high-precision
      measurements of the planets' motions.
      A contradictory character, Brahe enjoyed lecturing other nobles about the
      evils of dueling, but had lost his own
      nose in a youthful duel and had it replaced with a prosthesis made of an
      alloy of gold and silver. Willing to 
      endure scandal in order to marry a peasant, he nevertheless used the feudal
      powers given to him by the king to
      impose harsh forced labor on the inhabitants of his parishes. The result

With Brahe's death, it fell to his former assistant Kepler
to try to make some sense out of the volumes of data.
Kepler, in contradiction to his late boss, had formed a
prejudice, a correct one as it turned out, in favor of the
theory that the earth and planets revolved around the sun,
rather than the earth staying fixed and everything rotating
about it. Although motion is relative, it is not just a
matter of opinion what circles what. The earth's rotation
and revolution about the sun make it a noninertial reference
frame, which causes detectable violations of Newton's laws
when one attempts to describe sufficiently precise
experiments in the earth-fixed frame. Although such direct
experiments were not carried out until the 19th century,
what convinced everyone of the sun-centered system in the
17th century was that Kepler was able to come up with a
surprisingly simple set of mathematical and geometrical
rules for describing the planets' motion using the
sun-centered assumption. After 900 pages of calculations and
many false starts and dead-end ideas, Kepler finally
synthesized the data into the following \index{Kepler's laws}three laws:


\index{Kepler's laws!elliptical orbit law}

Although the planets' orbits are ellipses rather than
circles, most are very close to being circular.  The earth's
orbit, for instance, is only flattened by 1.7\% relative to
a circle.  In the special case of a planet in a circular
orbit, the two foci (plural of ``focus'') coincide at the
center of the circle, and Kepler's elliptical orbit law thus
says that the circle is centered on the sun. The equal-area
law implies that a planet in a circular orbit moves around
the sun with constant speed.  For a circular orbit, the law
of periods then amounts to a statement that $T^2$ is proportional
to $r^3$, where $r$ is the radius. If
all the planets were moving in their orbits at the same
speed, then the time for one orbit would only increase with
the circumference of the circle, so we would have a simple
proportionality between $T$ and $r$. Since this is not the
case, we can interpret the law of periods to mean that different
planets orbit the sun at different speeds. In fact, the outer
planets move more slowly than the inner ones.

\begin{eg}{Jupiter and Uranus}\label{eg:jupiter-uranus-numerical}
\egquestion The planets Jupiter and Uranus have very nearly circular orbits,
and the radius of Uranus's orbit is about four times grater than that of
Jupiter's orbit. Compare their orbital periods.

\eganswer If all the planets moved at the same speed, then it would take
Uranus four times longer to complete the four-times-greater circumference of
its orbit. However, the law of periods tells us that this isn't the case.
We expect Uranus to take \emph{more} than four times as long to orbit the sun.

The law of periods is stated as a proportionality, and
proportionalities are statements about quantities in proportion to one
another, i.e.. about division. We're given information about Uranus's
orbital radius divided by Jupiter's, and what we should expect to get
out is information about Uranus's period divided by Jupiter's. Let's
call the latter ratio $y$. Then we're looking for a number $y$ such that
\begin{align*}
  y^2 &= 4^3 \qquad , \\
\intertext{i.e.,}
  y \times y &= 4 \times 4 \times 4 \\
  y \times y &= 64 \\
  y &= 8
\end{align*}
The law of periods predicts that Uranus's period will be eight times
greater than Jupiter's, which is indeed what is observed (to within the
precision to be expected since the given figure of 4 was just stated
roughly as a whole number, for convenience in calculation).
\end{eg}

What Newton discovered was the reasons why Kepler's laws were true: he showed
that they followed from his laws of motion. From a modern point of view,
conservation laws are more fundamental than Newton's laws, so rather than
following Newton's approach, it makes more sense to look for the reasons
why Kepler's laws follow from conservation laws. The equal-area law is
most easily understood as a consequence of conservation of angular momentum,
which is a new conserved quantity to be discussed in chapter \ref{ch:angular-momentum}.
The proof of the elliptical orbit law is a little too mathematical to be appropriate
for this book, but the interested reader can find the proof in chapter 15 of
my online book \emph{Light and Matter}.

The law of periods follows directly from the physics we've
already covered. Consider the example of Jupiter and Uranus. We want to show
that the result of example \ref{eg:jupiter-uranus-numerical} is the only one that's consistent with conservation
of energy and momentum, and Newton's law of gravity. Since Uranus takes eight
times longer to cover four times the distance, it's evidently moving at half
Jupiter's speed. In figure \figref{law-of-periods-example}, the distance Jupiter
covers from A to B is therefore twice the distance Uranus covers, over the same time,
from D to E. If there hadn't been any gravitational force from the sun, Jupiter would
have ended up at C, and Uranus at F. The distance from B to C is a measure of how much
force acted on Jupiter, and likewise for the very small distance from E to F. We find
that BC is 16 millimeters on this scale drawing, and EF is 1 mm, but this is exactly what
we expect from Newton's law of gravity: quadrupling the distance should give
1/16 the force.

Imagine a black box\footnote{``Black box'' is a traditional engineering term
for a device whose inner workings we don't care about.}, containing a gasoline-powered
engine, which is designed to reel in a steel cable of length $d$, exerting a certain force $F$.

<% marg(30) %>
<%
  fig(
    'blackbox',
    %q{The black box does work by reeling in its cable.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
If we use this black box was to lift a weight, then by the time it has pulled in its whole cable,
it will have lifted the weight through a height $d$. The force $F$ is barely capable of lifting a
weight $m$ if $F=mg$, and if it does this, then the upward force from the cable exactly cancels
the downward force of gravity, so the weight will rise at constant speed, without changing its
kinetic energy. Only gravitational energy is transferred into the weight, and the amount of
gravitational energy is $mgd$, which equals $Fd$. By conservation of energy, this must also be the amount of
energy lost from the chemical energy of the gasoline inside the box.\footnote{For conceptual simplicity, we ignore the transfer of
        heat energy to the outside world via the exhaust and radiator. In reality, the
        sum of these energies plus the useful kinetic energy transferred would equal $W$.}

Now what if we use the black box to pull a plow? The energy increase in the outside
world is of a different type than before: mainly heat created by friction between the
dirt and the ploughshare. The box,
however, only communicates with the outside world via the hole through which its
cable passes. The amount of chemical energy lost by the gasoline can therefore
only depend on $F$ and $d$, so again the amount of energy transferred must equal
$Fd$.

The same reasoning can in fact be applied no matter what the cable is being used to
do. There must always be a transfer of energy from the box to the outside world
that is equal to $Fd$. In general, when energy is transferred, we refer to the amount
of energy transferred as \emph{work}, $W$. If, as in the example of the black box,
the motion of the object to which the
force is applied is in the same direction as the force, then $W=Fd$.

      The baseball pitcher put kinetic energy

If the
motion is in the opposite direction compared to the force, then $W=-Fd$; the negative
work is to be interpreted as energy removed from the object to which the force was applied.
For example, if Superman gets in front of an oncoming freight train, and brings
it to a stop, he's decreased its energy rather than increasing it. In a normal
gasoline-powered car, stepping on the brakes takes away the car's kinetic energy
(doing negative work on it), and turns it into heat in the brake shoes. In an
electric or hybrid-electric car, the car's kinetic energy is transformed back
into electrical energy to be used again.
