So far we've been discussing relativity according to Galileo and Newton, but there is also relativity according 
to Einstein.
When Einstein first began to develop the theory of relativity, around 1905, the only real-world observations he
could draw on were ambiguous and indirect.
Today, the evidence is part of everyday life. For example,
every time you use a GPS receiver, \figref{gps-on-bike}, you're using Einstein's theory of relativity.
Somewhere between 1905 and today, technology became good enough to allow conceptually \emph{simple} experiments
that students in the early 20th century could only discuss in terms like ``Imagine that we could\ldots''
A good jumping-on point is 1971. In that year, J.C.~Hafele and R.E.~Keating,\label{hafele-keating-discussed}
shown in the photo above,
brought atomic clocks aboard commercial
airliners, and went around the world, once from east to west and once from west to east.
The clocks were capable of keeping time to within a few nanoseconds. (A nanosecond, abbreviated ns,
is one billionth of a second.)
Hafele and Keating observed that there was a discrepancy between the times measured by the
traveling clocks and the times measured by similar clocks that stayed home at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington.
The east-going clock lost time, ending up off by $-59$ nanoseconds, while
the west-going one gained $273$ ns.

<% begin_sec("Causality",nil,'causality') %>\label{causality-defined}
It reassuring that the effects on time were
small compared to the three-day lengths of the plane trips. There was therefore no
opportunity for paradoxical scenarios such as one in which the east-going experimenter arrived
back in Washington before he left and then convinced himself not to take the trip.
A theory that maintains this kind of orderly relationship between cause and effect is said to satisfy causality.\index{causality}
<% end_sec('causality') %>

<% begin_sec("Time affected by motion and gravity",nil,'hk-interp') %>
Hafele and Keating were testing specific quantitative predictions of relativity, and they verified them to within
their experiment's error bars. Let's work backward instead, and
inspect the empirical results for clues as to how time works.

The two traveling clocks experienced effects in opposite directions,
and this suggests that the rate at which time flows depends on the motion
of the observer. The east-going clock was moving in the same direction as the earth's rotation, so its velocity
relative to the earth's center was greater than that of the clock that remained in Washington, while the west-going clock's velocity was
correspondingly reduced. The fact that the east-going clock fell behind, and the west-going one got ahead,
shows that the effect of motion is to make time go more slowly. This effect of motion on time was predicted by
Einstein in his original 1905 paper on relativity, written when he was 26.

  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

If this had been the only effect in the Hafele-Keating experiment, then we would have expected to see effects on the
two flying clocks that were equal in size.
In fact, the two effects are unequal in size: $-59$ ns and 273 ns. This
turns out to be because there was a second effect involved, a gravitational one,
simply due to the planes' being up in the air. The gravitational effects are beyond the scope of this book.

The effects that Hafele and Keating observed were small.
This makes sense: the version of relativity worked out by Galileo (sections
\ref{sec:principle-of-inertia} and \ref{sec:momentum}, 
pp.~\pageref{sec:principle-of-inertia}-\pageref{end-of-momentum-section})
had already been thoroughly tested by experiments under a wide variety of conditions,
so a new theory like Einstein's relativity must agree with Galileo's to a good approximation, 
within the Galilean theory's
realm of applicability. This is an example of
the correspondence principle (p.~\pageref{subsec:correspondence-principle}).\index{correspondence principle!for time dilation}
The behavior of the three clocks in the
Hafele-Keating experiment shows that the amount of time distortion increases as the speed of the clock's motion
increases. Newton lived in an era when the fastest
mode of transportation was a galloping horse, and the best
pendulum clocks would accumulate errors of perhaps a minute over the course of several days.
A horse is much slower than a jet plane, so the
distortion of time would have had a relative size of only $\sim10^{-15}$ --- much smaller than the clocks were capable of detecting.
At the speed of a passenger jet, the effect is about $10^{-12}$,
and state-of-the-art atomic clocks in 1971 were capable of measuring that.
A GPS satellite travels much faster than a jet airplane, and the effect on the satellite
turns out to be $\sim10^{-10}$. The general idea here is that all physical laws are approximations, and
approximations aren't simply right or wrong in different situations. Approximations are better or worse
in different situations, and the question is whether a particular approximation is good enough in a given
situation to serve a particular purpose. The faster the motion, the worse the Newtonian approximation of
absolute time. Whether the approximation is good enough depends on what you're trying to accomplish.
The correspondence principle says that the approximation must have been good enough to explain
all the experiments done in the centuries before Einstein came up with relativity.
<% end_sec('correspondence-principle-relativity') %>

By the way, don't get an inflated idea of the importance of the Hafele-Keating
experiment. Relativity had already been confirmed by a vast and varied body of experiments decades
before 1971. The only reason I'm giving such a prominent role to this experiment
is that it is conceptually very direct.
<% end_sec('t-rel') %>
<% begin_sec("Distortion of time and space",nil,'xt-distortion') %>
Relativity says that when two observers are in different frames of reference, each observer considers
the other one's perception of time to be distorted. We'll also
see that something similar happens to their observations of distances, so both space and
time are distorted.
What exactly is this distortion? How do we even conceptualize it?

The idea isn't really as radical as it might seem at first. We can visualize the structure of space
and time using a graph with position and time on its axes. These graphs were introduced
on p.~\pageref{fig:collision-x-t} in figures \figref{collision-x-t} and \figref{galilean-transformation},
but we're going to look at them in a slightly different way. Before, we used them to describe the motion
of objects. The grid underlying the graph was merely the stage on which the actors played their parts.
Now the background comes to the foreground: it's time and space themselves that we're studying.
We don't necessarily need to have a line or a curve drawn on top of the grid to represent a particular
object. We may, for example, just want to talk about events, depicted as points on the graph as in
figure \figref{joan-of-arc}. A distortion of the Cartesian grid underlying the graph can arise for
perfectly ordinary reasons that Isaac Newton would have readily accepted. For example, we can simply
change the units used to measure time and position, as in figure \figref{change-of-units}. 

We're going to
have quite a few examples of this type, so I'll adopt the convention shown in figure \figref{change-of-units-convention}
for depicting them; this convention was originally introduced in
figure \figref{galilean-transformation} on p.~\pageref{fig:galilean-transformation}.
Figure \figref{change-of-units-convention} summarizes the relationship between figures
\figref{joan-of-arc} and \figref{change-of-units} in a more compact form. The gray rectangle represents the
original coordinate grid of figure \figref{joan-of-arc}, while the grid of black lines represents the new version
from figure \figref{change-of-units}. Omitting the grid from the gray rectangle makes the diagram easier
to decode visually.


Our goal of unraveling the mysteries of special relativity amounts to nothing more than finding out how to
draw a diagram like \figref{change-of-units-convention} in the case where the two different sets of coordinates represent
measurements of time and space made by two different observers, each in motion relative to the other.
Galileo and Newton thought they knew the answer to this question, but their answer turned out to be
only approximately right. To avoid repeating the same mistakes, we need to clearly spell out what we think are
the basic properties of time and space that will be a reliable foundation for our reasoning.

Experiments show that:\label{spacetime-properties}

\vspace{10mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The laws of physics have translation symmetry (section \ref{sec:translation-symmetry}),
      time symmetry (section \ref{sec:noether-energy}), and rotational symmetry
      (p.~\pageref{rotational-symmetry} and section \ref{sec:noether-ang-mom}).
\item The principle of inertia holds (p.~\pageref{subsec:principle-of-inertia}).
\item Causality holds, in the sense described on page \pageref{causality-defined}.
\item Time depends on the state of motion of the observer.
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{10mm}

If it were not for property 4, we could imagine that figure \figref{galilean-boost} would
give the correct transformation between frames of reference in motion relative to one another.
Let's say that observer 1, whose grid coincides with the gray rectangle, is a hitch-hiker standing
by the side of a road. Event A is a raindrop hitting his head, and event B is another raindrop hitting
his head. He says that A and B occur at the same location in space. Observer 2 is a motorist who
drives by without stopping; to him, the passenger compartment of his car is at rest, while the
asphalt slides by underneath. He says that A and B occur at different points in space, because
during the time between the first raindrop and the second, the hitch-hiker has moved backward.
On the other hand, observer 2 says that events A and C occur in the same place, while the hitch-hiker
disagrees. The slope of the grid-lines is simply the velocity of the relative motion of each observer
relative to the other. (Recall that slope is defined as the rise over the run. On these graphs of distance
versus time, the slope is the distance traveled divided by the elapsed time.)

\enlargethispage{-20mm}

Figure \figref{galilean-boost} has familiar, comforting, and eminently sensible
behavior, but it also happens to be wrong, because it violates property 4. The distortion of
the coordinate grid has only moved the vertical lines up and down, so both observers agree
that events like B and C are simultaneous. If this was really the way things worked, then
all observers could synchronize all their clocks with one another for once and for all, and
the clocks would never get out of sync. This contradicts the results of the Hafele-Keating
experiment, in which all three clocks were initially synchronized in Washington, but later
went out of sync because of their different states of motion.

Based on properties 1-4, there is only one possible way to modify \figref{galilean-boost},
which is the one shown in \figref{smooshing}.\footnote{For a proof that no other version is possible,
see ch.~23 of my free online book \emph{Light and Matter}.}
This distortion is the one that Einstein predicted in 1905, and is known as the Lorentz transformation,
after Hendrik Lorentz (1853-1928).\index{Lorentz, Hendrik}\index{Lorentz transformation}
The distortion is a kind of smooshing and stretching, as suggested by the hands.
Also, we've already seen in figures
\figref{joan-of-arc}-\figref{change-of-units-convention} on page \pageref{fig:joan-of-arc} that we're free to stretch
or compress everything as much as we like in the horizontal and vertical directions, because this simply corresponds
to choosing different units of measurement for time and distance. In figure \figref{smooshing} I've chosen units that
give the whole drawing a convenient symmetry about a 45-degree diagonal line. Ordinarily it wouldn't make sense to
talk about a 45-degree angle on a graph whose axes had different units. But in relativity, the symmetric appearance of
the transformation tells us that space and time ought to be treated on the same footing, 
and measured in the same units.\label{natural-units}

The exact size and shape of the parallelogram are controlled by the requirements that\label{lorentz-properties}
(i) the slope labeled in the figure corresponds properly to the velocity;
(ii) the units are the special ones described above; and
(iii) the area of the parallelogram is the same as the area of the original square.\footnote{The equal-area
property is proved in \emph{Light and Matter}.}

$\mygamma$ (Greek letter gamma)
as in figure \figref{gamma-as-projection}.
An observer in motion relative to the clock at speed $v$ perceives the
clock as running more slowly by a factor of $\mygamma$.
For example, if $\mygamma$ equals 2, then the observer says the clock runs at
half its normal speed.

to find the value of $\mygamma$ for a given velocity $v$
of the clock and the observer relative to one another.
By plotting many such points,\footnote{To avoid the tedious work of drawing
many figures like \figref{gamma-by-measurement},

\begin{eg}{The garage paradox}\label{eg:garage-paradox}\index{garage paradox}
One of the most famous of all the so-called relativity
paradoxes has to do with our incorrect 
feeling that simultaneity is well defined. The idea is that
one could take a schoolbus and drive it at relativistic
speeds into a garage of ordinary size, in which it normally
would not fit. Because of the length contraction, the bus
would supposedly fit in the garage. The driver, however, will perceive the
\emph{garage} as being contracted and thus even less able to
contain the bus. 

The paradox is
resolved when we recognize that the concept of fitting the
bus in the garage ``all at once'' contains a hidden
assumption, the assumption that it makes sense to ask
whether the front and back of the bus can \emph{simultaneously} be
in the garage. Observers in different frames of reference
moving at high relative speeds do not necessarily agree on
whether things happen simultaneously. As shown in figure \figref{schoolbus-with-x-t}, the person in the
garage's frame can shut the door at an instant B he perceives
to be simultaneous with the front bumper's arrival A at the
back wall of the garage, but the driver would not agree
about the simultaneity of these two events, and would
perceive the door as having shut long after she plowed
through the back wall.

Let's think a little more about the role of the 45-degree diagonal in the Lorentz transformation.
Slopes on these graphs are interpreted as velocities.
This line has a slope of 1 in our special
relativistic units, but that slope corresponds to some number, call it $c$, in ordinary units
of meters per second.
Now note what happens when we perform a Lorentz transformation: this particular line gets stretched, but the new version
of the line lies right on top of the old one, and its slope stays the
same. In other words, if one observer says  that something has a velocity equal to $c$, every other observer will agree
on that velocity as well.

<% begin_sec("Velocities don't simply add and subtract.") %>\label{relativistic-combination-of-vel}
This is counterintuitive, since we expect velocities to
add and subtract in relative motion. If a dog is running away from me at
5 m/s relative to the sidewalk, and I run after it at 3 m/s,
the dog's velocity in my frame of reference is 2 m/s.
According to everything we have learned about motion, the
dog must have different speeds in the two frames: 5 m/s in
the sidewalk's frame and 2 m/s in mine. But velocities are measured by dividing a distance by a time, and
both distance and time are distorted by relativistic effects, so we actually shouldn't expect the ordinary
arithmetic addition of velocities to hold in relativity; it's an approximation that's valid at velocities
that are small compared to $c$.

probe was then moving at a velocity of $1.2c$, but in fact the answer is still less 
than $c$ (problem \ref{hw:six-tenths-c-twice}, page \pageref{hw:six-tenths-c-twice}).

a universal speed limit. This is required by causality, as shown in figure \figref{speed-limit}.

       B happens before A. The time ordering of the two events has been reversed. This can only happen because
       events A and B are very close together in time and fairly far apart in space. The line segment
       connecting A and B has a slope greater than 1, meaning that if we wanted to be present at both events, we would
       have to travel at a speed greater than $c$ (which equals 1 in the units used on this graph). You will find that if
       you pick any two points for which the slope of the line segment connecting them is less than 1, you can never get them
       to straddle the new $t=0$ line in this funny, time-reversed way. Since different observers disagree on the time order
       of events like A and B, causality requires that information never travel from A to B or from B to A; if it did, then

Now consider a beam of light. We're used to talking casually about the ``speed of light,'' but what does that really
mean? Motion is relative, so normally if we want to talk about a velocity, we have to specify what it's measured
relative to. A sound wave has a certain speed relative to the air, and a water wave has its own speed relative to the
water. If we want to measure the speed of an ocean wave, for example, we should make sure to measure it in a frame
of reference at rest relative to the water. But light isn't a vibration of a physical medium; it can propagate through the near-perfect vacuum of outer space,
as when rays of sunlight travel to earth. This seems like a paradox: light is supposed to have a specific speed,
but there is no way to decide what frame of reference to measure it in. The way out of the paradox is that light
must travel at a velocity equal to $c$. Since all observers agree on a velocity of $c$, regardless of their frame
of reference, everything is consistent.

<% begin_sec("The Michelson-Morley experiment") %>
The constancy of the speed of light had in fact already been
observed when Einstein was an 8-year-old boy, but because nobody could
figure out how to interpret it, the result was largely ignored.
In 1887 Michelson and Morley set up a clever apparatus to
measure any difference in the speed of light beams traveling
east-west and north-south. The motion of the earth around
the sun at 110,000 km/hour (about 0.01\% of the speed of
light) is to our west during the day. Michelson and Morley
believed that light was a vibration of a mysterious medium called the ether, so they expected that the
speed of light would be a fixed value relative to the ether.
As the earth moved through the ether, they thought they
would observe an effect on the velocity of light along an
east-west line. For instance, if they released a beam of
light in a westward direction during the day, they expected
that it would move away from them at less than the normal
speed because the earth was chasing it through the ether.
They were surprised when they found that the expected 0.01\%
change in the speed of light did not occur.\index{Michelson-Morley experiment}\index{ether}

split into two parts, sent around the perimeter of the device, and reunited. Since
the speed of light is constant, we expect the two parts to come back together at the
same time. If they don't, it's evidence that the device has been rotating. The plane's

outpourings of high-frequency light, believed to originate from a supernova explosion
in another galaxy. One such observation,

heads off in a spaceship for Tau Ceti, a nearby star. Tau Ceti is 12 light-years
away, so even though Betty travels at 87\% of the speed of light, it will take
her a long time to get there: 14 years, according to Alice.

Betty
experiences time dilation. At this speed, her $\gamma$ is 2.0, so that the voyage will
only seem to her to last 7 years. But there is perfect symmetry between Alice's
and Betty's frames of reference, so Betty agrees with Alice on their relative speed;
Betty sees herself as being at rest, while the sun and Tau Ceti both move backward
at 87\% of the speed of light. How, then, can she observe Tau Ceti to get to her
in only 7 years, when it should take 14 years to travel 12 light-years at this speed?

We need to take into account length contraction.
Betty sees the distance between the sun and Tau Ceti
to be shrunk by a factor of 2. The same thing occurs for Alice, who observes
Betty and her spaceship to be foreshortened.

So far we have said nothing about how to predict motion in
relativity. Do Newton's laws still work? Do conservation
laws still apply? The answer is yes, but many of the
definitions need to be modified, and certain entirely new
phenomena occur, such as the conversion of mass to energy
and energy to mass, as described by the famous equation
$E=mc^2$.

Here's a flawed scheme for traveling faster than the speed of light.
The basic idea can be demonstrated by dropping a ping-pong ball and a baseball
stacked on top of each other like a snowman. They separate slightly in mid-air,
and the baseball therefore has time to hit the floor and rebound before it
collides with the ping-pong ball, which is still on the way down. The result is
a surprise if you haven't seen it before: the ping-pong ball flies off at high
speed and hits the ceiling! A similar fact is known to people who investigate the
scenes of accidents involving pedestrians. If a car moving at 90 kilometers per
hour hits a pedestrian, the pedestrian flies off at nearly double that speed, 180
kilometers per hour. Now suppose the car was moving at 90 percent of the speed of
light. Would the pedestrian fly off at 180\% of $c$?

To see why not, we have to back up a little and think about where this speed-doubling
result comes from. 
For any collision, there is a special frame of reference, the center-of-mass frame,
in which the two colliding objects approach each other,
collide, and rebound with their velocities reversed. In the center-of-mass frame,
the total momentum of the objects is zero both before and after the collision.

Figure \subfigref{unequalcollision}{1} shows such a frame of reference for objects of very unequal mass.
Before the collision, the large ball is moving relatively slowly toward the top of the page, but
because of its greater mass, its momentum cancels the momentum of the smaller ball, which is
moving rapidly in the opposite direction. The total momentum is zero. After the collision, the
two balls just reverse their directions of motion. We know that this is the
right result for the outcome of the collision because
it conserves both momentum and kinetic energy, and everything not forbidden is compulsory, i.e.,
in any experiment, there is only one possible outcome, which is the one that obeys all the
conservation laws.

one 8 kg. In frame 1, let's make the velocities as follows:

end
end

<% print small_vel_table(-0.8,0.8,0.1,-0.1) %>

Figure \subfigref{unequalcollision}{2} shows the same collision in a frame of reference where
the small ball was initially at rest.
 To find all the velocities in this frame, we
just add 0.8 to all the ones in the previous table.

<% print small_vel_table(0,1.6,0.9,0.7) %>

\noindent In this frame, as expected, the small ball flies off with a velocity, 1.6, that
is almost twice the initial velocity of the big ball, 0.9.

If all those velocities were in meters per second, then that's exactly what happened. But
what if all these velocities were in units of the speed of light? Now it's no longer a good
approximation just to add velocities. We need to combine them according to the relativistic
rules. For instance, reasoning similar to that 
in problem \ref{hw:six-tenths-c-twice}, page \pageref{hw:six-tenths-c-twice}
tells us that combining a velocity of 0.8 times the
speed of light with another velocity of 0.8 results in 0.98, not 1.6. The results are very different:

<% print small_vel_table(0,0.98,0.83,0.76) %>

    },
    {
      'width'=>'wide',
      'sidecaption'=>true
    }
  )
%>

We can interpret this as follows. Figure \subfigref{unequalcollision}{1} is one in which the
big ball is moving fairly slowly. This is very nearly the way the scene would be seen by an
ant standing on the big ball. According to an observer in frame \figref{unequalrel}, however,
both balls are moving at nearly the speed of light after the collision. Because of this, the
balls appear foreshortened, but the distance between the two balls is also shortened. To this
observer, it seems that the small ball isn't pulling away from the big ball very fast.

Now here's what's interesting about all this. The outcome shown in figure \subfigref{unequalcollision}{2}
was supposed to be the only one possible, the only one that satisfied both conservation of energy
and conservation of momentum. So how can the \emph{different} result shown in figure
\figref{unequalrel} be possible? The answer is that relativistically, momentum must not equal
$mv$. The old, familiar definition is only an approximation that's valid at low speeds. If
we observe the behavior of the small ball in figure \figref{unequalrel}, it looks as though it
somehow had some extra inertia. It's as though a football player tried to knock another player
down without realizing that the other guy had a three-hundred-pound bag full of lead shot
hidden under his uniform --- he just doesn't seem to react to the collision as much as he should.
This extra inertia is described by redefining momentum as
\begin{equation*}
        \text{momentum} = m \gamma v\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
At very low velocities, $\gamma$ is close to 1, and the result is very nearly $mv$, as demanded
by the correspondence principle. But at very high velocities, $\gamma$ gets very big --- the
small ball in figure \figref{unequalrel} has a $\gamma$ of 5.0, and therefore has five times
more inertia than we would expect nonrelativistically.\index{correspondence principle!for relativistic momentum}



<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("Equivalence of mass and energy") %>\index{energy!equivalence to mass}\index{mass!equivalence to energy}
Now we're ready to see why mass and energy must be equivalent as claimed
in the famous $E=mc^2$. So far we've only considered collisions
in which none of the kinetic energy is converted into any other form
of energy, such as heat or sound.
Let's consider what happens if a blob of putty moving at
velocity $v$ hits another blob that is initially at rest,
sticking to it.  The nonrelativistic result is
that to obey conservation of momentum the two blobs must fly
off together at $v/2$. Half of the initial kinetic energy
has been converted to heat.\footnote{A double-mass object moving
at half the speed does not have the same kinetic energy. Kinetic
energy depends on the square of the velocity, so cutting the velocity
in half reduces the energy by a factor of 1/4, which, multiplied
by the doubled mass, makes 1/2 the original energy.}

Relativistically, however, an interesting thing happens. A
hot object has more momentum than a cold object! This is
because the relativistically correct expression for momentum
is $m\gamma v$, and the more rapidly moving atoms in the hot
object have higher values of $\gamma$.
In our collision, the final combined blob must therefore be
moving a little more slowly than the expected $v/2$, since
otherwise the final momentum would have been a little
greater than the initial momentum. To an observer who
believes in conservation of momentum and knows only about
the overall motion of the objects and not about their heat
content, the low velocity after the collision would seem
to be the result of a magical change in the mass, as if the mass
of two combined, hot blobs of putty was more than the sum of
their individual masses.

Now we know that the masses of all the atoms in the blobs
must be the same as they always were. The change is due to
the change in $\gamma$ with heating, not to a change in mass.
The heat energy, however, seems to be acting as if it was
equivalent to some extra mass.


But this whole argument was based on the fact that heat is a
form of kinetic energy at the atomic level. Would $E=mc^2$
apply to other forms of energy as well? Suppose a rocket
ship contains some electrical energy stored in a
battery. If we believed that $E=mc^2$ applied to forms of
kinetic energy but not to electrical energy, then
we would have to believe that the pilot of the rocket could
slow the ship down by using the battery to run a heater!
This would not only be strange, but it would violate the
principle of relativity, because the result of the
experiment would be different depending on whether the ship
was at rest or not. The only logical conclusion is that all
forms of energy are equivalent to mass. Running the heater
then has no effect on the motion of the ship, because the
total energy in the ship was unchanged; one form of energy (electrical)
was simply converted to another (heat).

The equation $E=mc^2$
tells us how much energy is equivalent to how much mass: the conversion factor is the square
of the speed of light, $c$. Since $c$ a big number, you get a really really big number
when you multiply it by itself to get $c^2$. This means that even a small amount of mass
is equivalent to a very large amount of energy. 

We've already seen several examples of applications of $E=mc^2$, on page
\pageref{eg:eclipse}.

simultaneously. Bob, meanwhile, is sitting aboard the train, at its middle. 
He passes by Alice at the moment when Alice later figures out that the flashes happened.
Later, he receives flash 2, and then flash 1. He infers that since both flashes traveled
