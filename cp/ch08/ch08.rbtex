If you've read chapter \ref{ch:fields}, you've been introduced to the
idea that the universe isn't really mechanical in nature. It's made of
fields of force. When a radio antenna makes a disturbance in the electric
and magnetic fields, those disturbances travel outward like ripples on
a pond. In other words, waves are fundamental to the way the universe
works.

<% begin_sec("Vibrations",0) %>


Your radio dial is calibrated in units of \emph{frequency},\index{frequency}
the simplest example of this concept is provided not by a wave but
by a vibrating physical object such as a mass on the end of a spring, \figref{mass-on-spring}.
With no forces on it, the spring assumes its equilibrium length,
\figref{mass-on-spring}/1. It can be stretched, 2, or compressed, 3. We attach
the spring to a wall on the left and to a mass on the right.
If we now hit the mass with a hammer, 4, it oscillates as
shown in the series of snapshots, 4-13. If we assume that
the mass slides back and forth without friction and that the
motion is one-dimensional, then conservation of energy
proves that the motion must be repetitive. When the block
comes back to its initial position again, 7, its potential
energy is the same again, so it must have the same kinetic
energy again. The motion is in the opposite direction,
however. Finally, at 10, it returns to its initial position
with the same kinetic energy and the same direction of
motion. The motion has gone through one complete cycle, and
will now repeat forever in the absence of friction.

The usual physics terminology for motion that repeats itself
over and over is \index{motion!periodic}periodic motion, and
the time required for one repetition is called the
\index{period!defined}period, $T$. One
complete repetition of the motion is called a cycle.

We are used to referring to short-period sound vibrations as
``high'' in pitch, and it sounds odd to have to say that
high pitches have low periods. It is therefore more common
to discuss the rapidity of a vibration in terms of the
number of vibrations per second, a quantity called the
\index{frequency!defined}frequency, $f$. Since the period is
the number of seconds per cycle and the frequency is the
number of cycles per second, they are reciprocals of each other,
\begin{equation*}
                f  =  1/T   \qquad   .
\end{equation*}

Units of inverse second, $\sunit^{-1}$, are awkward in speech, so an
abbreviation has been created. One Hertz, named in honor of
a pioneer of radio technology, is one cycle per second. In
abbreviated form, $1\ \zu{Hz}=1\ \sunit^{-1}$. This is the familiar unit
used for the frequencies on the radio dial.

\begin{eg}{Frequency of a radio station}
\egquestion KMHD's frequency is 89.1 MHz. What does this mean,
and what period does this correspond to?

\eganswer The metric prefix M- is mega-, i.e., millions. The
radio waves emitted by KMHD's transmitting antenna vibrate
89.1 million times per second. This corresponds to a period of
\begin{equation*}
 T = 1/f= 1.12\times10^{-8}\ \sunit \qquad .
\end{equation*}

This example shows a second reason why we normally speak in
terms of frequency rather than period: it would be painful
to have to refer to such small time intervals routinely. I
could abbreviate by telling people that KMHD's period was
11.2 nanoseconds, but most people are more familiar with the
big metric prefixes than with the small ones.
\end{eg}

Units of frequency are also commonly used to specify the
speeds of computers. The idea is that all the little
circuits on a computer chip are synchronized by the very
fast ticks of an electronic clock, so that the circuits can
all cooperate on a task without getting ahead or behind.
Adding two numbers might require, say, 30 clock cycles.
Microcomputers these days operate at clock frequencies
of about a gigahertz.

%>
\label{fig:amplitude-examples}
<% end_marg %>
We have discussed how to measure how fast something
vibrates, but not how big the vibrations are. The general
term for this is \index{amplitude!defined}amplitude, $A$. The
definition of amplitude depends on the system being
discussed, and two people discussing the same system may not
even use the same definition. In the example of the block on
the end of the spring, \figref{amplitude-examples}/1, the amplitude will be measured in
distance units such as cm. One could work in terms of the
distance traveled by the block from the extreme left to the
extreme right, but it would be somewhat more common in
physics to use the distance from the center to one extreme.
The former is usually referred to as the \index{amplitude!peak-to-peak}peak-to-peak
amplitude, since the extremes of the motion look like
mountain peaks or upside-down mountain peaks on a graph of
position versus time.

In other situations we would not even use the same units for
amplitude. The amplitude of a child on a swing, or a pendulum, \figref{amplitude-examples}/2, would most
conveniently be measured as an angle, not a distance, since
her feet will move a greater distance than her head. The
electrical vibrations in a radio receiver would be measured
in electrical units such as volts or amperes.

%>
<% end_marg %>
In many physical examples of vibrations, the force that brings
the vibrating object back to equilibrium gets stronger and
stronger as the object gets father and farther from equilibrium,
and the force is directly proportional to the distance from
equilibrium. Most springs behave this way, for example, so
for example we'd expect that the spring in figure \figref{mass-on-spring}
would make very nearly twice the force when stretched twice as much.
We then define a spring constant,\index{spring constant}, which
tells us how many newtons of force we get per meter of stretching.
For example, the John Hancock Tower has a spring constant of about
200 MN/m (meganewtons per meter), meaning that the wind must exert a force of about
200 MN in order to make the tower sway by one meter. To make it sway by two meters,
the force would have to be 400 MN.

 % Published data are f=0.14 Hz, ht=241 m. I estimated mass by scaling Empire State's mass of 3.65 10^8 kg linearly with height.

When the force has this type of mathematical behavior, the resulting
motion is known as \emph{simple harmonic motion}. One surprising and
useful fact about simple harmonic motion is that its frequency is independent
of amplitude. Intuitively, we would expect that vibrations with a greater
amplitude would take more time, i.e., have a lower frequency. However,
when the amplitude is greater, the force accelerating the mass back toward
the equilibrium position is also greater, and this turns out to compensate
exactly for the need to travel a greater distance. Legend has it that
Galileo first noticed this fact when he watched a chandelier swinging during
a church service, and timed it against his pulse.
Mathematically, the frequency of vibration is given by $f=(1/2\pi)\sqrt{k/m}$,
where $k$ is the spring constant, and $m$ is the mass that is vibrating.

<% begin_sec("Wave Motion",0) %>

There are three main ways in which wave motion differs from
the motion of objects made of matter.

<% begin_sec("1. Superposition") %>

The first, and most profound, difference between wave motion
and the motion of objects is that waves do not display any
repulsion of each other analogous to the normal forces
between objects that come in contact. Two wave patterns can
therefore overlap in the same region of space, as shown in
the figure at the top of the page. Where the two waves
coincide, they add together. For instance, suppose that at a
certain location in at a certain moment in time, each wave
would have had a crest 3 cm above the normal water level.
The waves combine at this point to make a 6-cm crest. We use
negative numbers to represent depressions in the water. If
both waves would have had a troughs measuring -3 cm, then
they combine to make an extra-deep -6 cm trough. A +3 cm
crest and a -3 cm trough result in a height of zero, i.e.,
the waves momentarily cancel each other out at that point.
This additive rule is referred to as the 
\index{principle of superposition}principle of superposition, ``superposition''
being merely a fancy word for ``adding.''

Superposition can occur not just with sinusoidal waves like
the ones in the figure above but with waves of any shape.
The figures on the following page show superposition of wave
\index{pulse!defined}\emph{pulses}. A pulse is simply a wave of
very short duration. These pulses consist only of a single
hump or trough. If you hit a clothesline sharply, you will
observe pulses heading off in both directions. This is
analogous to the way ripples spread out in all directions
when you make a disturbance at one point on water. The same
occurs when the hammer on a piano comes up and hits a string.

\startdq

\begin{dq}
In figure \figref{coil-spring-superposition}, the fifth frame shows the spring
just about perfectly flat. If the two pulses have essentially
canceled each other out perfectly, then why does the motion
pick up again? Why doesn't the spring just stay flat?

initial position, but is not carried along with the wave.
This shows that the water itself does not flow outward with
the wave. If it did, we could empty one end of a swimming
pool simply by kicking up waves! We must distinguish between
the motion of the medium (water in this case) and the motion
of the wave pattern through the medium. The medium vibrates;
the wave progresses through space.

\begin{eg}{Surfing}\label{eg:surfing}
The incorrect belief that the medium moves with the wave is
often reinforced by garbled secondhand knowledge of surfing.
Anyone who has actually surfed knows that the front of the
board pushes the water to the sides, creating a wake --- the
surfer can even drag his hand through the water, as in in figure
\figref{surfing-hand-drag}. If the
water was moving along with the wave and the surfer, this
wouldn't happen. The surfer is carried forward because
forward is downhill, not because of any forward flow of the
water. If the water was flowing forward, then a person
floating in the water up to her neck would be carried along
just as quickly as someone on a surfboard. In fact, it is
even possible to surf down the back side of a wave, although
the ride wouldn't last very long because the surfer and the
wave would quickly part company.

<% end_marg %>

A material object can move with any velocity, and can be
sped up or slowed down by a force that increases or
decreases its kinetic energy. Not so with waves. The
magnitude of a wave's velocity depends on the properties of
the medium (and perhaps also on the shape of the wave, for
certain types of waves). Sound waves travel at about 340 m/s
in air, 1000 m/s in helium.\index{sound!speed of} If you kick up water waves in a
pool, you will find that kicking harder makes waves that are
taller (and therefore carry more energy), not faster. The
sound waves from an exploding stick of dynamite carry a lot
of energy, but are no faster than any other waves. In the
following section we will give an example of the physical
relationship between the wave speed and the properties of the medium.

\begin{eg}{Breaking waves}\label{eg:breaking-wave}
The velocity of water waves
increases with depth. The crest of a wave
travels faster than the trough, and this can cause
the wave to break.
\end{eg}

Once a wave is created, the only reason its speed will
change is if it enters a different medium or if the
properties of the medium change. It is not so surprising
that a change in medium can slow down a wave, but the
reverse can also happen. A sound wave traveling through a
helium balloon will slow down when it emerges into the air,
but if it enters another balloon it will speed back up
again! Similarly, water waves travel more quickly over
deeper water, so a wave will slow down as it passes over an
underwater ridge, but speed up again as it emerges into deeper water.

\begin{eg}{Hull speed}\label{eg:hull-speed}
 The speeds of most boats, and of some surface-swimming
animals, are limited by the fact that they make a wave due
to their motion through the water. The boat in figure \figref{hull-speed}
is going at the same speed as its own waves, and can't go any faster.
No matter how hard the boat pushes
against the water, it can't make the wave move ahead faster and get out of the
way. The wave's speed depends only on the medium. Adding energy to the wave
doesn't speed it up, it just increases its amplitude.

A water wave, unlike many other types of wave, has a speed
that depends on its shape: a broader wave moves faster. The
shape of the wave made by a boat tends to mold itself to
the shape of the boat's hull, so a boat with a longer hull
makes a broader wave that moves faster. The maximum speed of
a boat whose speed is limited by this effect is therefore
closely related to the length of its hull, and the maximum
speed is called the hull speed. Sailboats designed for racing are
not just long and skinny to make
them more streamlined --- they are also long so that their
hull speeds will be high.

<% end_marg %>
If the magnitude of a wave's velocity vector is preordained,
what about its direction? Waves spread out in all directions
from every point on the disturbance that created them. If
the disturbance is small, we may consider it as a single
point, and in the case of water waves the resulting wave
pattern is the familiar circular ripple, \figref{wave-patterns}/1. If, on the other
hand, we lay a pole on the surface of the water and wiggle
it up and down, we create a linear wave pattern, \figref{wave-patterns}/2. For a
three-dimensional wave such as a sound wave, the analogous
patterns would be spherical waves and plane waves,
\figref{wave-patterns-three-d}.

Infinitely many patterns are possible, but linear or plane
waves are often the simplest to analyze, because the
velocity vector is in the same direction no matter what part
of the wave we look at. Since all the velocity vectors are
parallel to one another, the problem is effectively
one-dimensional. Throughout this chapter and the next, we
will restrict ourselves mainly to wave motion in one
dimension, while not hesitating to broaden our horizons when
it can be done without too much complication.

<% begin_sec("Sound waves") %>

The phenomenon of sound is easily found to have all the
characteristics we expect from a wave phenomenon:

\begin{itemize}
\item Sound waves obey superposition. Sounds do not knock other
sounds out of the way when they collide, and we can hear
more than one sound at once if they both reach our ear simultaneously.

\item The medium does not move with the sound. Even standing in
front of a titanic speaker playing earsplitting music, we do
not feel the slightest breeze.

\item The velocity of sound depends on the medium. Sound travels
faster in helium than in air, and faster in water than in
helium. Putting more energy into the wave makes it more
intense, not faster. For example, you can easily detect an
echo when you clap your hands a short distance from a large,
flat wall, and the delay of the echo is no shorter for a louder clap.
\end{itemize}

Although not all waves have a speed that is independent of
the shape of the wave, and this property therefore is
irrelevant to our collection of evidence that sound is a
wave phenomenon, sound does nevertheless have this property.
For instance, the music in a large concert hall or stadium
may take on the order of a second to reach someone seated in
the nosebleed section, but we do not notice or care, because
the delay is the same for every sound. Bass, drums, and
vocals all head outward from the stage at 340 m/s,
regardless of their differing wave shapes.

If sound has all the properties we expect from a wave, then
what type of wave is it? It must be a vibration of a
physical medium such as air, since the speed of sound is
different in different media, such as helium or water.
Further evidence is that we don't receive sound signals that
have come to our planet through outer space. The roars and
whooshes of Hollywood's space ships are fun, but scientifically wrong.\footnote{Outer
space is not a perfect vacuum, so it is possible for sounds waves to travel through
it. However, if we want to create a sound wave, we typically do it by creating
vibrations of a physical object, such as the sounding board of a guitar,
the reed of a saxophone, or a speaker cone. The lower the density of the surrounding
medium, the less efficiently the energy can be converted into sound and
carried away. An isolated tuning fork, left to vibrate in interstellar space,
would dissipate the energy of its vibration into internal heat at a rate
many orders of magnitude greater than the rate of sound emission into the
nearly perfect vacuum around it.}

We can also tell that sound waves consist of compressions
and expansions, rather than sideways vibrations like the
shimmying of a snake. Only compressional vibrations would be
able to cause your eardrums to vibrate in and out. Even for
a very loud sound, the compression is extremely weak; the
increase or decrease compared to normal atmospheric pressure
is no more than a part per million. Our ears are apparently
very sensitive receivers!

<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("Light waves") %>

Entirely similar observations lead us to believe that light
is a wave, although the concept of light as a wave had a
long and tortuous history. It is interesting to note that
Isaac Newton very influentially advocated a contrary idea
about light. The belief that matter was made of atoms was
stylish at the time among radical thinkers (although there
was no experimental evidence for their existence), and it
seemed logical to Newton that light as well should be made
of tiny particles, which he called corpuscles (Latin for
``small objects''). Newton's triumphs in the science of
mechanics, i.e., the study of matter, brought him such great
prestige that nobody bothered to question his incorrect
theory of light for 150 years. One persuasive proof that
light is a wave is that according to Newton's theory, two
intersecting beams of light should experience at least some
disruption because of collisions between their corpuscles.
Even if the corpuscles were extremely small, and collisions
therefore very infrequent, at least some dimming should have
been measurable. In fact, very delicate experiments have
shown that there is no dimming.

The wave theory of light was entirely successful up until
the 20th century, when it was discovered that not all the
phenomena of light could be explained with a pure wave
theory. It is now believed that both light and matter are
made out of tiny chunks which have \emph{both} wave and
particle properties. For now, we will content ourselves with
the wave theory of light, which is capable of explaining a
great many things, from cameras to rainbows.

If light is a wave, what is waving? What is the medium that
wiggles when a light wave goes by? It isn't air. A vacuum is
impenetrable to sound, but light from the stars travels
happily through zillions of miles of empty space. Light
bulbs have no air inside them, but that doesn't prevent the
light waves from leaving the filament. For a long time,
physicists assumed that there must be a mysterious medium
for light waves, and they called it the aether (not to be
confused with the chemical). Supposedly the aether existed
everywhere in space, and was immune to vacuum pumps. 
We now know that, as discussed in chapter \ref{ch:fields}, light can instead be
explained as a wave pattern made up of electrical and magnetic fields.

<% begin_sec("Period and frequency of a periodic wave") %>

You choose a radio station by selecting a certain frequency.
We have already defined period and frequency for vibrations,
but what do they signify in the case of a wave? We can
recycle our previous definition simply by stating it in
terms of the vibrations that the wave causes as it passes a
receiving instrument at a certain point in space. For a
sound wave, this receiver could be an eardrum or a
microphone. If the vibrations of the eardrum repeat
themselves over and over, i.e., are periodic, then we
describe the sound wave that caused them as periodic.
Likewise we can define the period and frequency of a wave in
terms of the period and frequency of the vibrations it
causes. As another example, a periodic water wave would be
one that caused a rubber duck to bob in a periodic manner
as they passed by it.

The period of a sound wave correlates with our sensory
impression of musical pitch. A high frequency (short period)
is a high note. The sounds that really define the musical
notes of a song are only the ones that are periodic. It is
not possible to sing a non-periodic sound like ``sh''
with a definite pitch.

The frequency of a light wave corresponds to color. Violet
is the high-frequency end of the rainbow, red the low-frequency
end. A color like brown that does not occur in a rainbow is
not a periodic light wave. Many phenomena that we do not
normally think of as light are actually just forms of light
that are invisible because they fall outside the range of
frequencies our eyes can detect. Beyond the red end of the
visible rainbow, there are infrared and radio waves. Past
the violet end, we have ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays.

Some waves, like sound waves, are easy to study by placing
a detector at a certain location in space and studying the
motion as a function of time. The result is a graph whose
horizontal axis is time. With a water wave, on the other
hand, it is simpler just to look at the wave directly. This
visual snapshot amounts to a graph of the height of the
water wave as a function of \emph{position}. Any wave can be
represented in either way.

An easy way to visualize this is in terms of a strip chart
recorder, an obsolescing device consisting of a pen that
wiggles back and forth as a roll of paper is fed under it.
It can be used to record a person's electrocardiogram, or
seismic waves too small to be felt as a noticeable
earthquake but detectable by a seismometer. Taking the
seismometer as an example, the chart is essentially a record
of the ground's wave motion as a function of time, but if
the paper was set to feed at the same velocity as the motion
of an earthquake wave, it would also be a full-scale
representation of the profile of the actual wave pattern
itself. Assuming, as is usually the case, that the wave
velocity is a constant number regardless of the wave's
shape, knowing the wave motion as a function of time is
equivalent to knowing it as a function of position.

Any wave that is periodic will also display a repeating

letter lambda. Wavelength is to space as period is to time.

Suppose that we create a repetitive disturbance by kicking
the surface of a swimming pool. We are essentially making a
series of wave pulses. The wavelength is simply the distance
a pulse is able to travel before we make the next pulse. The
distance between pulses is $\lambda $, and the time between
pulses is the period, $T$, so the speed of the wave is the
distance divided by the time,
\begin{equation*}
                v    =    \lambda /T   .
\end{equation*}

This important and useful relationship is more commonly
written in terms of the frequency,

\begin{equation*}
                v    =    f \lambda    \qquad   .
\end{equation*}

\begin{eg}{Wavelength of radio waves}
\egquestion The speed of light is $3.0\times10^8$ m/s. What
is the wavelength of the radio waves emitted by KKJZ, a
station whose frequency is 88.1 MHz?

\eganswer Solving for wavelength, we have
\begin{align*}
 \lambda &= v/f \\
 &= (3.0\times10^8\ \munit/\sunit)/(88.1\times10^6\ \sunit^{-1}) \\
 &= 3.4\ \munit
\end{align*}
The size of a radio antenna is closely related to the
wavelength of the waves it is intended to receive. The match
need not be exact (since after all one antenna can receive
more than one wavelength!), but the ordinary ``whip''
antenna such as a car's is 1/4 of a wavelength. An antenna
optimized to receive KKJZ's signal would have a length of $3.4\ \munit/4= 0.85\ \munit$.

The equation $v=f \lambda $ defines a fixed relationship
between any two of the variables if the other is held fixed.
The speed of radio waves in air is almost exactly the same
for all wavelengths and frequencies (it is exactly the same
if they are in a vacuum), so there is a fixed relationship
between their frequency and wavelength. Thus we can say
either ``Are we on the same wavelength?'' or ``Are we on
the same frequency?''

A different example is the behavior of a wave that travels
from a region where the medium has one set of properties to
an area where the medium behaves differently. The frequency
is now fixed, because otherwise the two portions of the wave
would otherwise get out of step, causing a kink or
discontinuity at the boundary, which would be unphysical. (A
more careful argument is that a kink or discontinuity would
have infinite curvature, and waves tend to flatten out their
curvature. An infinite curvature would flatten out
infinitely fast, i.e., it could never occur in the first
place.) Since the frequency must stay the same, any change
in the velocity that results from the new medium must cause
a change in wavelength.

The velocity of water waves depends on the depth of the
water, so based on $\lambda =v/f$, we see that water waves
that move into a region of different depth must change their
wavelength, as shown in figure \figref{wavelength-change}. This effect
can be observed when ocean waves come up to the shore. If
the deceleration of the wave pattern is sudden enough, the
tip of the wave can curl over, resulting in a breaking wave.
