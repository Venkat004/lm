Dandelion. Cello. Read those two words, and your brain
instantly conjures a stream of associations, the most
prominent of which have to do with vibrations. Our mental
category of ``dandelion-ness'' is strongly linked to the
color of light waves that vibrate about half a million
billion times a second: yellow. The velvety throb of a cello
has as its most obvious characteristic a relatively low
musical pitch --- the note you are spontaneously imagining
right now might be one whose sound vibrations repeat at a
rate of a hundred times a second.

Evolution has designed our two most important senses around
the assumption that not only will our environment be
drenched with information-bearing vibrations, but in
addition those vibrations will often be repetitive, so that
we can judge colors and pitches by the rate of repetition.
Granting that we do sometimes encounter non-repeating waves
such as the consonant ``sh,'' which has no recognizable
\index{pitch}pitch, why was Nature's assumption of
repetition nevertheless so right in general?

Repeating phenomena occur throughout nature, from the orbits
of electrons in atoms to the reappearance of Halley's
\index{comet}\index{Halley's Comet}Comet every 75 years.
Ancient cultures tended to attribute repetitious phenomena
like the seasons to the cyclical nature of time itself, but
we now have a less mystical explanation. Suppose that
instead of Halley's Comet's true, repeating elliptical orbit
that closes seamlessly upon itself with each revolution, we
decide to take a pen and draw a whimsical alternative path
that never repeats. We will not be able to draw for very
long without having the path cross itself. But at such a
crossing point, the comet has returned to a place it visited
once before, and since its potential energy is the same as
it was on the last visit, conservation of energy proves that
it must again have the same kinetic energy and therefore the
same speed. Not only that, but the comet's direction of
motion cannot be randomly chosen, because angular momentum
must be conserved as well. Although this falls short of
being an ironclad proof that the comet's orbit must repeat,
it no longer seems surprising that it does.

Conservation laws, then, provide us with a good reason why
repetitive motion is so prevalent in the universe. But it
goes deeper than that. Up to this point in your study of
physics, I have been indoctrinating you with a mechanistic
vision of the universe as a giant piece of clockwork.
Breaking the clockwork down into smaller and smaller bits,
we end up at the atomic level, where the electrons circling
the nucleus resemble --- well, little clocks! From this
point of view, particles of matter are the fundamental
building blocks of everything, and vibrations and waves are
just a couple of the tricks that groups of particles can do.
But at the beginning of the 20th century, the tabled were
turned. A chain of discoveries initiated by Albert
\index{Einstein, Albert}Einstein led to the realization that
the so-called subatomic ``particles'' were in fact waves. In
this new world-view, it is vibrations and waves that are
fundamental, and the formation of matter is just one of the
tricks that waves can do.

Figure \figref{mass-on-spring} shows our most basic example of a vibration. With
no forces on it, the spring assumes its equilibrium length,
\figref{mass-on-spring}/1. It can be stretched, 2, or compressed, 3. We attach
the spring to a wall on the left and to a mass on the right.
If we now hit the mass with a hammer, 4, it oscillates as
shown in the series of snapshots, 4-13. If we assume that
the mass slides back and forth without friction and that the
motion is one-dimensional, then conservation of energy
proves that the motion must be repetitive. When the block
comes back to its initial position again, 7, its potential
energy is the same again, so it must have the same kinetic
energy again. The motion is in the opposite direction,
however. Finally, at 10, it returns to its initial position
with the same kinetic energy and the same direction of
motion. The motion has gone through one complete cycle, and
will now repeat forever in the absence of friction.

The usual physics terminology for motion that repeats itself
over and over is \index{motion!periodic}periodic motion, and
the time required for one repetition is called the
\index{period!defined}period, $T$. (The symbol $P$ is not
used because of the possible confusion with momentum.) One
complete repetition of the motion is called a cycle.

We are used to referring to short-period sound vibrations as
``high'' in pitch, and it sounds odd to have to say that
high pitches have low periods. It is therefore more common
to discuss the rapidity of a vibration in terms of the
number of vibrations per second, a quantity called the
\index{frequency!defined}frequency, $f$. Since the period is
the number of seconds per cycle and the frequency is the
number of cycles per second, they are reciprocals of each other,
\begin{equation*}
		f  =  1/T   \qquad   .

In the carnival game shown in figure \figref{carnival-game}, the rube is
supposed to push the bowling ball on the track just hard
enough so that it goes over the hump and into the valley,
but does not come back out again. If the only types of
energy involved are kinetic and potential, this is
impossible. Suppose you expect the ball to come back to a
point such as the one shown with the dashed outline, then
stop and turn around. It would already have passed through
this point once before, going to the left on its way into
the valley. It was moving then, so conservation of energy
tells us that it cannot be at rest when it comes back to the
same point. The motion that the customer hopes for is
physically impossible. There is a physically possible
periodic motion in which the ball rolls back and forth,
staying confined within the valley, but there is no way to
get the ball into that motion beginning from the place where
we start. There is a way to beat the game, though. If you
put enough spin on the ball, you can create enough kinetic
friction so that a significant amount of heat is generated.
Conservation of energy then allows the ball to be at rest
when it comes back to a point like the outlined one, because
kinetic energy has been converted into heat.

\begin{eg}{Period and frequency of a fly's wing-beats}
A Victorian parlor trick was to listen to the pitch of a
fly's buzz, reproduce the musical note on the piano, and
announce how many times the fly's wings had flapped in one
second. If the fly's wings flap, say, 200 times in one
second, then the frequency of their motion is $f=200/1\ \sunit=200\ \sunit^{-1}$.
The period is one 200th of a second, $T=1/f=(1/200)\ \sunit=0.005\ \sunit$.
\end{eg}

Units of inverse second, $\sunit^{-1}$, are awkward in speech, so an
abbreviation has been created. One Hertz, named in honor of
a pioneer of radio technology, is one cycle per second. In
abbreviated form, $1\ \zu{Hz}=1\ \sunit^{-1}$. This is the familiar unit
used for the frequencies on the radio dial.

\begin{eg}{Frequency of a radio station}
\egquestion KKJZ's frequency is 88.1 MHz. What does this mean,
and what period does this correspond to?

\eganswer The metric prefix M- is mega-, i.e., millions. The
radio waves emitted by KKJZ's transmitting antenna vibrate
88.1 million times per second. This corresponds to a period of
\begin{equation*}
 T = 1/f= 1.14\times10^{-8}\ \sunit \qquad .
\end{equation*}

This example shows a second reason why we normally speak in
terms of frequency rather than period: it would be painful
to have to refer to such small time intervals routinely. I
could abbreviate by telling people that KKJZ's period was
11.4 nanoseconds, but most people are more familiar with the
big metric prefixes than with the small ones.
\end{eg}

Units of frequency are also commonly used to specify the
speeds of computers. The idea is that all the little
circuits on a computer chip are synchronized by the very
fast ticks of an electronic clock, so that the circuits can
all cooperate on a task without getting ahead or behind.
Adding two numbers might require, say, 30 clock cycles.
Microcomputers these days operate at clock frequencies
of about a gigahertz.

%>
<% end_marg %>
We have discussed how to measure how fast something
vibrates, but not how big the vibrations are. The general
term for this is \index{amplitude!defined}amplitude, $A$. The
definition of amplitude depends on the system being
discussed, and two people discussing the same system may not
even use the same definition. In the example of the block on
the end of the spring, \figref{amplitude-examples}/1, the amplitude will be measured in
distance units such as cm. One could work in terms of the
distance traveled by the block from the extreme left to the
extreme right, but it would be somewhat more common in
physics to use the distance from the center to one extreme.
The former is usually referred to as the \index{amplitude!peak-to-peak}peak-to-peak
amplitude, since the extremes of the motion look like
mountain peaks or upside-down mountain peaks on a graph of
position versus time.

In other situations we would not even use the same units for
amplitude. The amplitude of a child on a swing, or a pendulum, \figref{amplitude-examples}/2, would most
conveniently be measured as an angle, not a distance, since
her feet will move a greater distance than her head. The
electrical vibrations in a radio receiver would be measured
in electrical units such as volts or amperes.

If we actually construct the mass-on-a-spring system
discussed in the previous section and measure its motion
accurately, we will find that its $x-t$ graph is nearly a
perfect sine-wave shape, as shown in figure \figref{sinusoidal-x-t}/1. (We call it
a ``sine wave'' or ``sinusoidal'' even if it is a cosine, or
a sine or cosine shifted by some arbitrary horizontal
amount.) It may not be surprising that it is a wiggle of
this general sort, but why is it a specific mathematically
perfect shape? Why is it not a sawtooth shape like 2 or
some other shape like 3? The mystery deepens as we find
that a vast number of apparently unrelated vibrating systems
show the same mathematical feature. A \index{tuning fork}tuning fork,
a sapling pulled to one side and released,
a car bouncing on its shock absorbers, all these systems
will exhibit sine-wave motion under one condition: the
amplitude of the motion must be small.

It is not hard to see intuitively why extremes of amplitude
would act differently. For example, a car that is bouncing
lightly on its shock absorbers may behave smoothly, but if
we try to double the amplitude of the vibrations the bottom
of the car may begin hitting the ground, \figref{sinusoidal-x-t}/4. (Although we
are assuming for simplicity in this chapter that energy is
never dissipated, this is clearly not a very realistic
assumption in this example. Each time the car hits the
ground it will convert quite a bit of its potential and
kinetic energy into heat and sound, so the vibrations would
actually die out quite quickly, rather than repeating for
many cycles as shown in the figure.)

The key to understanding how an object vibrates is to know
how the force on the object depends on the object's
position. If an object is vibrating to the right and left,
then it must have a leftward force on it when it is on the
right side, and a rightward force when it is on the left
side. In one dimension, we can represent the direction of
the force using a positive or negative sign, and since the
force changes from positive to negative there must be a
point in the middle where the force is zero. This is the
equilibrium point, where the object would stay at rest if it
was released at rest. For convenience of notation throughout
this chapter, we will define the origin of our coordinate
system so that $x$ equals zero at equilibrium.

The simplest example is the mass on a spring, for which
force on the mass is given by \index{Hooke's law}Hooke's law,
\begin{equation*}
		F    =    -kx   \qquad   .
\end{equation*}
We can visualize the behavior of this force using a graph of
$F$ versus $x$, as shown in figure \figref{force-curve-1}. The graph is a line, and the
spring constant, $k$, is equal to minus its slope. A stiffer
spring has a larger value of $k$ and a steeper slope.
Hooke's law is only an approximation, but it works very well
for most springs in real life, as long as the spring isn't
compressed or stretched so much that it is permanently bent or damaged.

The following important theorem, whose proof is given in
optional section \ref{sec:proofs}, relates the motion graph to the force graph.

\index{simple harmonic motion!period of}
\begin{lessimportant}{Theorem: A linear
force graph makes a sinusoidal motion graph.}

\noindent If the total force on a vibrating object depends only on the
object's position, and is related to the objects displacement
from equilibrium by an equation of the form $F=-kx$,
then the object's motion displays a sinusoidal graph with period $T=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$.
\end{lessimportant}

Even if you do not read the proof, it is not too hard to
understand why the equation for the period makes sense. A
greater mass causes a greater period, since the force will
not be able to whip a massive object back and forth very
rapidly. A larger value of $k$ causes a shorter period,
because a stronger force can whip the object back and forth more rapidly.

This may seem like only an obscure theorem about the
mass-on-a-spring system, but figure \figref{force-curve-2} shows it to
be far more general than that. Figure \figref{force-curve-2}/1 depicts a force
curve that is not a straight line. A system with this $F-x$
curve would have large-amplitude vibrations that were
complex and not sinusoidal. But the same system would
exhibit sinusoidal small-amplitude vibrations. This is
because any curve looks linear from very close up. If we
magnify the $F-x$ graph as shown in figure \figref{force-curve-2}/2, it becomes very
difficult to tell that the graph is not a straight line. If
the vibrations were confined to the region shown in \figref{force-curve-2}/2,
they would be very nearly sinusoidal. This is the reason why
sinusoidal vibrations are a universal feature of all
vibrating systems, if we restrict ourselves to small
amplitudes. The theorem is therefore of great general
significance. It applies throughout the universe, to objects
ranging from vibrating stars to vibrating nuclei. A
sinusoidal vibration is known as \index{simple harmonic
motion!defined}simple harmonic motion.

\mysubsection[0]{Period is approximately independent of amplitude, if the amplitude is small.}

Until now we have not even mentioned the most counterintuitive
aspect of the equation  $T=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$: it does not depend on amplitude at
all. Intuitively, most people would expect the mass-on-a-spring
system to take longer to complete a cycle if the amplitude
was larger. (We are comparing amplitudes that are different
from each other, but both small enough that the theorem
applies.) In fact the larger-amplitude vibrations take the
same amount of time as the small-amplitude ones. This is because
at large amplitudes, the force is greater, and therefore accelerates
the object to higher speeds.

 Legend has it that this fact was first noticed by
\index{Galileo}Galileo during what was apparently a less
than enthralling church service. A gust of wind would now
and then start one of the chandeliers in the cathedral
swaying back and forth, and he noticed that regardless of
the amplitude of the vibrations, the period of oscillation
seemed to be the same. Up until that time, he had been
carrying out his physics experiments with such crude
time-measuring techniques as feeling his own pulse or
singing a tune to keep a musical beat. But after going home
and testing a pendulum, he convinced himself that he had
found a superior method of measuring time. Even without a
fancy system of pulleys to keep the pendulum's vibrations
from dying down, he could get very accurate time measurements,
because the gradual decrease in amplitude due to friction
would have no effect on the pendulum's period. (Galileo
never produced a modern-style pendulum clock with pulleys, a
minute hand, and a second hand, but within a generation the
device had taken on the form that persisted for hundreds of years after.)

\begin{eg}{The pendulum}
\egquestion Compare the periods of pendula having bobs
with different masses.

\eganswer From the equation  $T=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$, we might expect that a larger
mass would lead to a longer period. However, increasing the
mass also increases the forces that act on the pendulum:
gravity and the tension in the string. This increases $k$ as
well as $m$, so the period of a pendulum is independent of $m$.

      the $x$ and $y$ components of its velocity are continuously changing, as shown by the unequal spacing of the points when projected

In this section we prove (1) that a linear $F-x$ graph gives
sinusoidal motion, (2) that the period of the motion is $2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$,
and (3) that the period is independent of the amplitude. You
may omit this section without losing the continuity of the chapter.

The basic idea of the proof can be understood by imagining
that you are watching a child on a merry-go-round from far
away. Because you are in the same horizontal plane as her
motion, she appears to be moving from side to side along a
line. Circular motion viewed edge-on doesn't just look like
any kind of back-and-forth motion, it looks like motion with
a sinusoidal $x-t$ graph, because the sine and cosine
functions can be defined as the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of a
point at angle $\theta $ on the unit circle. The idea of the
proof, then, is to show that an object acted on by a force
that varies as $F=-kx$ has motion that is identical
to circular motion projected down to one dimension. The
equation will also fall out nicely at the end.

For an object performing uniform circular motion, we have
\begin{equation*}
		|\vc{a}|	 =    \frac{v^2}{r}   \qquad   .
\end{equation*}
The $x$ component of the acceleration is therefore
\begin{equation*}
			a_x	 =    \frac{v^2}{r}\cos\theta   \qquad   ,
\end{equation*}
where $\theta $ is the angle measured counterclockwise from
the $x$ axis. Applying Newton's second law,
\begin{align*}
 \frac{F_x}{m} &= -\frac{v^2}{r}\cos\theta \qquad , \qquad \text{so} \\
 F_x &= -m\frac{v^2}{r}\cos\theta \qquad .
\end{align*}
Since our goal is an equation involving the period, it is
natural to eliminate the variable $v = \text{circumference}/T=2\pi r/T$, giving
\begin{equation*}
			F_x	 =    -\frac{4\pi^2 mr}{T^2}\cos\theta   \qquad   .
\end{equation*}
The quantity $r \cos \theta $ is the same as $x$, so we have
\begin{equation*}
			F_x	 =    -\frac{4\pi^2 m}{T^2}\: x    \qquad   .
\end{equation*}
Since everything is constant in this equation except for
$x$, we have proved that motion with force proportional to
$x$ is the same as circular motion projected onto a line,
and therefore that a force proportional to $x$ gives
sinusoidal motion. Finally, we identify the constant factor
of $4\pi^2m/T^2$ with $k$, and solving for $T$ gives the desired
equation for the period,
\begin{equation*}
			T	 =     2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}  \qquad   .
\end{equation*}
Since this equation is independent of $r$, $T$ is independent of the amplitude,
subject to the initial assumption of perfect $F=-kx$ behavior, which in reality
will only hold approximately for small $x$.

\begin{eg}{The moons of Jupiter.}\label{eg:jovian-moons}
The idea behind this proof is aptly illustrated by the moons
of Jupiter. Their discovery by Galileo was an epochal event
in astronomy, because it proved that not everything in the
universe had to revolve around the earth as had been
believed. Galileo's telescope was of poor quality by modern
standards, but figure \figref{jovian-moons} shows a simulation of how
Jupiter and its moons might appear at intervals of three
hours through a large present-day instrument. Because we see
the moons' circular orbits edge-on, they appear to perform
sinusoidal vibrations. Over this time period, the innermost
moon, Io, completes half a cycle.

Periodic motion is common in the world around us because of
conservation laws. An important example is one-dimensional
motion in which the only two forms of energy involved are
potential and kinetic; in such a situation, conservation of
energy requires that an object repeat its motion, because
otherwise when it came back to the same point, it would have
to have a different kinetic energy and therefore a
different total energy.

Not only are periodic vibrations very common, but small-amplitude
vibrations are always sinusoidal as well. That is, the $x-t$
graph is a sine wave. This is because the graph of force
versus position will always look like a straight line on a
sufficiently small scale. This type of vibration is called
simple harmonic motion. In simple harmonic motion, the
period is independent of the amplitude, and is given by

 A pneumatic spring consists of a piston riding on top
of the air in a cylinder. The upward force of the air on
the piston is given by $F_{air}=ax^{-1.4}$, where $a$ is a
constant with funny units of $\nunit\unitdot\munit^{1.4}$. For simplicity,
assume the air only supports the weight, $F_W$, of the
piston itself, although in practice this device is used to
support some other object. The equilibrium position, $x_0$,
is where $F_W$ equals $-F_{air}$. (Note that in the main
text I have assumed the equilibrium position to be at $x=0$,
but that is not the natural choice here.) Assume friction
is negligible, and consider a case where the amplitude of
the vibrations is very small. Let $a=1\ \nunit\unitdot\munit^{1.4}$, 
$x_0=1.00\ \munit$, and $F_W=-1.00\ \nunit$. The piston is released from

force, $F$, as a function of $x$, on graph paper, covering

plugging in $h-h_0$ gives a total force of zero. (c) Find the
cube's period of oscillation as it bobs up and down in the
water, and show that can be expressed in terms of and $g$ only.

\begin{hw}[2]{}\label{hw:codornices}
The figure shows a see-saw with two springs at
Codornices Park in Berkeley, California. Each spring has
spring constant $k$, and a kid of mass $m$ sits on each
seat. (a) Find the period of vibration in terms of the
variables $k$, $m$, $a$, and $b$. (b) Discuss the special case
where $a=b$, rather than $a>b$ as in the real see-saw. (c)
Show that your answer to part a also makes sense in the case of $b=0$.

A hot scientific question of the 18th century was the shape
of the earth: whether its radius was greater at the equator than at the poles, or the
other way around. One method used to attack this question was to measure gravity
accurately in different locations on the earth using pendula. If the highest
and lowest latitudes accessible to explorers were 0 and 70 degrees, then
the the strength of gravity would in reality be observed to vary over a range from
about 9.780 to 9.826 $\munit/\sunit^2$. This change, amounting to 0.046 $\munit/\sunit^2$,
is greater than the 0.022 $\munit/\sunit^2$ effect to be expected if the earth had been spherical.
The greater effect occurs because the equator feels a reduction due not just to the
acceleration of the spinning earth out from under it, but also to the greater radius of
the earth at the equator. What is the accuracy with which the period
of a one-second pendulum would have to be measured in order to prove that the earth
was not a sphere, and that it bulged at the equator?
