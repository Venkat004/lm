Speech is what separates humans most decisively from
animals. No other species can master syntax, and even though
chimpanzees can learn a vocabulary of hand signs, there is
an unmistakable difference between a human infant and a baby
chimp: starting from birth, the human experiments with the
production of complex speech sounds.

Since speech sounds are instinctive for us, we seldom think
about them consciously. How do we do control sound waves so
skillfully? Mostly we do it by changing the shape of a
connected set of hollow cavities in our chest, throat, and
head. Somehow by moving the boundaries of this space in and
out, we can produce all the vowel sounds. Up until now, we
have been studying only those properties of waves that can
be understood as if they existed in an infinite, open space
with no boundaries. In this chapter we address what happens
when a wave is confined within a certain space, or when a
wave pattern encounters the boundary between two different
media, such as when a light wave moving through air
encounters a glass windowpane.

\mysection{Reflection, Transmission, and Absorption}\label{sec:reflection-and-transmission}

\mysubsection[0]{Reflection and transmission}

Sound waves can echo back from a cliff, and light waves are
\index{reflection of waves}reflected from the surface of a
pond. We use the word reflection, normally applied only to
light waves in ordinary speech, to describe any such case of
a wave rebounding from a barrier. Figure \figref{circular-reflection} shows a
circular water wave being reflected from a straight wall. In
this chapter, we will concentrate mainly on reflection of
waves that move in one dimension, as in figure \figref{pulse-reflected-from-fixed-end}.

<% end_marg %>
Wave reflection does not surprise us. After all, a material
object such as a rubber ball would bounce back in the same
way. But waves are not objects, and there are some surprises in store.

First, only part of the wave is usually reflected. Looking
out through a window, we see light waves that passed through
it, but a person standing outside would also be able to see
her reflection in the glass. A light wave that strikes the
glass is partly \emph{reflected} and partly \emph{transmitted}
(passed) by the glass. The energy of the original wave is
split between the two. This is different from the behavior
of the rubber ball, which must go one way or the other, not both.

Second, consider what you see if you are swimming underwater
and you look up at the surface. You see your own reflection.
This is utterly counterintuitive, since we would expect the
light waves to burst forth to freedom in the wide-open air.
A material projectile shot up toward the surface would never
rebound from the water-air boundary!

What is it about the difference between two media that
causes waves to be partly reflected at the boundary between
them? Is it their density? Their chemical composition?
Ultimately all that matters is the speed of the wave in the
two media. \emph{A wave is partially reflected and partially
transmitted at the boundary between media in which it has
different speeds.} For example, the speed of light waves in
window glass is about 30\% less than in air, which explains
why windows always make reflections. Figures \figref{coil-spring-reflections}/1 and 2
show examples of wave pulses being reflected at the boundary
between two coil springs of different weights, in which the
wave speed is different.

Reflections such as \figref{circular-reflection} and \figref{pulse-reflected-from-fixed-end}, where a wave encounters a
massive fixed object, can usually be understood on the same
basis as cases like \figref{coil-spring-reflections}/1 and 2 later in his section, where
two media meet. Example \figref{pulse-reflected-from-fixed-end}, for instance, is like a more
extreme version of example \figref{coil-spring-reflections}/1. If the heavy coil spring in
\figref{coil-spring-reflections}/1 was made heavier and heavier, it would end up acting
like the fixed wall to which the light spring in \figref{pulse-reflected-from-fixed-end} has been attached.

\begin{selfcheck}{reflected-energy}
In figure \figref{pulse-reflected-from-fixed-end}, the reflected pulse is upside-down, but
its depth is just as big as the original pulse's height. How
does the energy of the reflected pulse compare with
that of the original?

\begin{eg}{Fish have internal ears.}\label{eg:fish-ears}
Why don't fish have ear-holes? The speed of sound waves in a
fish's body is not much different from their speed in water,
so sound waves are not strongly reflected from a fish's
skin. They pass right through its body, so fish can have internal ears.

\begin{eg}{Whale songs traveling long distances}\label{eg:whale-songs}
Sound waves travel at drastically different speeds through
rock, water, and air. Whale songs are thus strongly
reflected at both the bottom and the surface. The sound
waves can travel hundreds of miles, bouncing repeatedly
between the bottom and the surface, and still be detectable.
Sadly, noise pollution from ships has nearly shut down this
cetacean version of the internet.

Radio communication can occur between stations on opposite

The use of the word ``reflection'' naturally brings to mind
the creation of an image by a mirror, but this might be
confusing, because we do not normally refer to ``reflection''
when we look at surfaces that are not shiny. Nevertheless,
reflection is how we see the surfaces of all objects, not
just polished ones. When we look at a sidewalk, for example,
we are actually seeing the reflecting of the sun from the
concrete. The reason we don't see an image of the sun at our
feet is simply that the rough surface blurs the image so drastically.

\mysubsection[0]{Inverted and uninverted reflections}

Notice how the pulse reflected back to the right in example
\figref{coil-spring-reflections}/1 comes back upside-down, whereas the one reflected back
to the left in 2 returns in its original upright form.
This is true for other waves as well. In general, there are
two possible types of reflections, a reflection back into a
faster medium and a reflection back into a slower medium.
One type will always be an inverting reflection and one noninverting.

<% end_marg %>
It's important to realize that when we discuss inverted and
uninverted reflections on a string, we are talking about
whether the wave is flipped across the direction of motion
(i.e., upside-down in these drawings). The reflected pulse
will always be reversed front to back, as shown in figure
\figref{rope-reflections}. This is because it is traveling in the other
direction. The leading edge of the pulse is what gets
reflected first, so it is still ahead when it starts back to
the left --- it's just that ``ahead'' is now in the opposite direction.

\mysubsection[0]{Absorption}\index{absorption of waves}

So far we have tacitly assumed that wave energy remains as
wave energy, and is not converted to any other form. If this
was true, then the world would become more and more full of
sound waves, which could never escape into the vacuum of
outer space. In reality, any mechanical wave consists of a
traveling pattern of vibrations of some physical medium, and
vibrations of matter always produce heat, as when you bend a
coat-hangar back and forth and it becomes hot. We can thus
expect that in mechanical waves such as water waves, sound
waves, or waves on a string, the wave energy will gradually
be converted into heat. This is referred to as \emph{absorption}.

The wave suffers a decrease in amplitude, as shown in figure
\figref{attenuation}. The decrease in amplitude amounts to the same
fractional change for each unit of distance covered. For
example, if a wave decreases from amplitude 2 to amplitude 1
over a distance of 1 meter, then after traveling another
meter it will have an amplitude of 1/2. That is, the
reduction in amplitude is exponential. This can be proven as
follows. By the principle of superposition, we know that a
wave of amplitude 2 must behave like the superposition of
two identical waves of amplitude 1. If a single amplitude-1
wave would die down to amplitude 1/2 over a certain
distance, then two amplitude-1 waves superposed on top of
one another to make amplitude $1+1=2$ must die down to
amplitude $1/2+1/2=1$ over the same distance.

\begin{selfcheck}{absorption-and-speed}
As a wave undergoes absorption, it loses energy. Does this
mean that it slows down?

  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
In many cases, this frictional heating effect is quite weak.
Sound waves in air, for instance, dissipate into heat
extremely slowly, and the sound of church music in a
cathedral may reverberate for as much as 3 or 4 seconds
before it becomes inaudible. During this time it has
traveled over a kilometer! Even this very gradual dissipation
of energy occurs mostly as heating of the church's walls and
by the leaking of sound to the outside (where it will
eventually end up as heat). Under the right conditions
(humid air and low frequency), a sound wave in a straight
pipe could theoretically travel hundreds of kilometers
before being noticeable attenuated.

In general, the absorption of mechanical waves depends a
great deal on the chemical composition and microscopic
structure of the medium. Ripples on the surface of
antifreeze, for instance, die out extremely rapidly compared
to ripples on water. For sound waves and surface waves in
liquids and gases, what matters is the viscosity of the
substance, i.e., whether it flows easily like water or
mercury or more sluggishly like molasses or antifreeze. This
explains why our intuitive expectation of strong absorption
of sound in water is incorrect. Water is a very weak
absorber of sound (viz. whale songs and sonar), and our
incorrect intuition arises from focusing on the wrong
property of the substance: water's high density, which is
irrelevant, rather than its low viscosity, which is what matters.

Light is an interesting case, since although it can travel
through matter, it is not itself a vibration of any material
substance. Thus we can look at the star Sirius, $10^{14}$
km away from us, and be assured that none of its light was
absorbed in the vacuum of outer space during its 9-year
journey to us. The Hubble Space Telescope routinely observes
light that has been on its way to us since the early history
of the universe, billions of years ago. Of course the energy
of light can be dissipated if it does pass through matter
(and the light from distant galaxies is often absorbed if
there happen to be clouds of gas or dust in between).

\begin{eg}{Soundproofing}\label{eg:soundproofing}
Typical amateur musicians setting out to soundproof their
garages tend to think that they should simply cover the
walls with the densest possible substance. In fact, sound is
not absorbed very strongly even by passing through several
inches of wood. A better strategy for soundproofing is to
create a sandwich of alternating layers of materials in
which the speed of sound is very different, to encourage reflection.

The classic design is alternating layers of fiberglass and
plywood. The speed of sound in plywood is very high, due to
its stiffness, while its speed in fiberglass is essentially
the same as its speed in air. Both materials are fairly good
sound absorbers, but sound waves passing through a few
inches of them are still not going to be absorbed sufficiently.
The point of combining them is that a sound wave that tries
to get out will be strongly reflected at each of the
fiberglass-plywood boundaries, and will bounce back and
forth many times like a ping pong ball. Due to all the
back-and-forth motion, the sound may end up traveling a
total distance equal to ten times the actual thickness of
the soundproofing before it escapes. This is the equivalent
of having ten times the thickness of sound-absorbing material.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{The swim bladder}
The swim bladder of a fish, which was first discussed in homework problem \ref{hw:swimbladder} in chapter \ref{ch:resonance}, is often located
 right next to the fish's ear. As discussed in example \ref{eg:fish-ears} on page \pageref{eg:fish-ears}, the fish's body
 is nearly transparent to sound, so it's actually difficult to get any of the
 sound wave energy to deposit itself in the fish so that the fish can hear it!
 The physics here is almost exactly the same as the physics of example \ref{eg:soundproofing} above,
 with the gas-filled swim bladder playing the role of the low-density material.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Radio transmission}
A radio transmitting station, such as a commercial station
or an amateur ``ham'' radio station, must have a length of
wire or cable connecting the amplifier to the antenna. The
cable and the antenna act as two different media for radio
waves, and there will therefore be partial reflection of the
waves as they come from the cable to the antenna. If the
waves bounce back and forth many times between the amplifier
and the antenna, a great deal of their energy will be
absorbed. There are two ways to attack the problem. One
possibility is to design the antenna so that the speed of
the waves in it is as close as possible to the speed of the waves in the
cable; this minimizes the amount of reflection. The other method is to
connect the amplifier to the antenna using a type of wire or
cable that does not strongly absorb the waves. Partial
reflection then becomes irrelevant, since all the wave
energy will eventually exit through the antenna.
\end{eg}

A sound wave that underwent a pressure-inverting reflection
would have its compressions converted to expansions and vice
versa. How would its energy and frequency compare with those

happens if you swap the two wires where they connect to a
stereo speaker, resulting in waves that vibrate in the opposite way?
\end{dq}

\myoptionalsection{Quantitative Treatment of Reflection}\label{sec:quantitative-reflection}

In this optional section we analyze the reasons why
reflections occur at a speed-changing boundary, predict
quantitatively the intensities of reflection and transmission,
and discuss how to predict for any type of wave which
reflections are inverting and which are noninverting. The
gory details are likely to be of interest mainly to students
with concentrations in the physical sciences, but all
readers are encouraged at least to skim the first two
subsections for physical insight.

\mysubsection[0]{Why reflection occurs}

      1. A change in frequency without a change in wavelength
      would produce a discontinuity in the wave.\\
      2. A simple change in wavelength without a reflection would result in a sharp kink in the wave.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
To understand the fundamental reasons for what does occur at
the boundary between media, let's first discuss what doesn't
happen. For the sake of concreteness, consider a sinusoidal
wave on a string. If the wave progresses from a heavier
portion of the string, in which its velocity is low, to a
lighter-weight part, in which it is high, then the equation
$v=f\lambda $ tells us that it must change its frequency, or
its wavelength, or both. If only the frequency changed, then
the parts of the wave in the two different portions of the
string would quickly get out of step with each other,
producing a discontinuity in the wave, \figref{kink-and-discontinuity}/1. This is
unphysical, so we know that the wavelength must change while
the frequency remains constant, 2.

But there is still something unphysical about figure 2.
The sudden change in the shape of the wave has resulted in a
sharp kink at the boundary. This can't really happen,
because the medium tends to accelerate in such a way as to
eliminate curvature. A sharp kink corresponds to an infinite
curvature at one point, which would produce an infinite
acceleration, which would not be consistent with the smooth
pattern of wave motion envisioned in figure 2. Waves can
have kinks, but not stationary kinks.

We conclude that without positing partial reflection of the
wave, we cannot simultaneously satisfy the requirements of
(1) continuity of the wave, and (2) no sudden changes in the
slope of the wave. (The student who has studied calculus
will recognize this as amounting to an assumption that both
the wave and its derivative are continuous functions.)

Does this amount to a proof that reflection occurs? Not
quite. We have only proven that certain types of wave motion
are not valid solutions. In the following subsection, we
prove that a valid solution can always be found in which a
reflection occurs. Now in physics, we normally assume (but
seldom prove formally) that the equations of motion have a
unique solution, since otherwise a given set of initial
conditions could lead to different behavior later on, but
the Newtonian universe is supposed to be deterministic.
Since the solution must be unique, and we derive below a
valid solution involving a reflected pulse, we will have
ended up with what amounts to a proof of reflection.

\mysubsection[0]{Intensity of reflection}

We will now show, in the case of waves on a string, that it
is possible to satisfy the physical requirements given above
by constructing a reflected wave, and as a bonus this will
produce an equation for the proportions of reflection and
transmission and a prediction as to which conditions will
lead to inverted and which to uninverted reflection. We
assume only that the principle of superposition holds, which
is a good approximations for waves on a string of sufficiently small amplitude.

      pulse heading to the right, toward the heavier string. For clarity, all but the first and last
      drawings are schematic. Once the reflected pulse begins to emerge from the boundary, it adds together
      with the trailing parts of the incident pulse. Their sum, shown as a wider line, is what is
      actually observed.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
Let the unknown amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted
waves be $R$ and $T$, respectively. An inverted reflection
would be represented by a negative value of $R$. We can
without loss of generality take the incident (original) wave
to have unit amplitude. Superposition tells us that if, for
instance, the incident wave had double this amplitude, we
could immediately find a corresponding solution simply by
doubling $R$ and $T$.

Just to the left of the boundary, the height of the wave is
given by the height 1 of the incident wave, plus the height
$R$ of the part of the reflected wave that has just been
created and begun heading back, for a total height of $1+R$.
On the right side immediately next to the boundary, the
transmitted wave has a height $T$. To avoid a discontinuity, we must have
\begin{equation*}
		1+R  =  T   \qquad   .
\end{equation*}
Next we turn to the requirement of equal slopes on both
sides of the boundary. Let the slope of the incoming wave be
$s$ immediately to the left of the junction. If the wave was
100\% reflected, and without inversion, then the slope of
the reflected wave would be $-s$, since the wave has been
reversed in direction. In general, the slope of the
reflected wave equals $-sR$, and the slopes of the
superposed waves on the left side add up to $s-sR$.
On the right, the slope depends on the amplitude, $T$, but
is also changed by the stretching or compression of the wave
due to the change in speed. If, for example, the wave speed
is twice as great on the right side, then the slope is cut
in half by this effect. The slope on the right is therefore
$s(v_1/v_2)T$, where $v_1$ is the velocity in the original
medium and $v_2$ the velocity in the new medium. Equality of
slopes gives $s-sR=s(v_1/v_2)T$, or
\begin{equation*}
  1-R = \frac{v_1}{v_2}T \qquad .
\end{equation*}
Solving the two equations for the unknowns $R$ and $T$ gives
\begin{equation*}
  R=\frac{v_2-v_1}{v_2+v_1} \quad \text{and} \quad T=\frac{2v_2}{v_2+v_1} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
The first equation shows that there is no reflection unless
the two wave speeds are different, and that the reflection
is inverted in reflection back into a fast medium.

The energies of the transmitted and reflected wavers always
add up to the same as the energy of the original wave. There
is never any abrupt loss (or gain) in energy when a wave
crosses a boundary. (Conversion of wave energy to heat
occurs for many types of waves, but it occurs throughout the
medium.) The equation for $T$, surprisingly, allows the
amplitude of the transmitted wave to be greater than 1, i.e.,
greater than that of the incident wave. This does not
violate conservation of energy, because this occurs when the
second string is less massive, reducing its kinetic energy,
and the transmitted pulse is broader and less strongly
curved, which lessens its potential energy.

\mysubsection[0]{Inverted and uninverted reflections in general}

For waves on a string, reflections back into a faster medium
are inverted, while those back into a slower medium are
uninverted. Is this true for all types of waves? The rather
subtle answer is that it depends on what property of the
wave you are discussing.

<% marg(0) %>
<%
  fig(
    'freeway-graphs-SHARED',
    %q{A disturbance in freeway traffic.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
Let's start by considering wave disturbances of freeway
traffic. Anyone who has driven frequently on crowded
freeways has observed the phenomenon in which one driver
taps the brakes, starting a chain reaction that travels
backward down the freeway as each person in turn exercises
caution in order to avoid rear-ending anyone. The reason why
this type of wave is relevant is that it gives a simple,
easily visualized example of our description of a wave
depends on which aspect of the wave we have in mind. In
steadily flowing freeway traffic, both the density of cars
and their velocity are constant all along the road. Since
there is no disturbance in this pattern of constant velocity
and density, we say that there is no wave. Now if a wave is
touched off by a person tapping the brakes, we can either
describe it as a region of high density or as a region of
decreasing velocity.

The freeway traffic wave is in fact a good model of a sound
wave, and a sound wave can likewise be described either by
the density (or pressure) of the air or by its speed.
Likewise many other types of waves can be described by
either of two functions, one of which is often the
derivative of the other with respect to position.

Now let's consider reflections. If we observe the freeway
wave in a mirror, the high-density area will still appear
high in density, but velocity in the opposite direction will
now be described by a negative number. A person observing
the mirror image will draw the same density graph, but the
velocity graph will be flipped across the $x$ axis, and its
original region of negative slope will now have positive
slope. Although I don't know any physical situation that
would correspond to the reflection of a traffic wave, we can
immediately apply the same reasoning to sound waves, which
often do get reflected, and determine that a reflection can
either be density-inverting and velocity-noninverting or
density-noninverting and velocity-inverting.

This same type of situation will occur over and over as one
encounters new types of waves, and to apply the analogy we
need only determine which quantities, like velocity, become
negated in a mirror image and which, like density, stay the same.

A light wave, for instance consists of a traveling pattern
of electric and magnetic fields. All you need to know in
order to analyze the reflection of light waves is how
electric and magnetic fields behave under reflection; you
don't need to know any of the detailed physics of electricity
and magnetism. An electric field can be detected, for
example, by the way one's hair stands on end. The direction
of the hair indicates the direction of the electric field.
In a mirror image, the hair points the other way, so the
electric field is apparently reversed in a mirror image. The
behavior of magnetic fields, however, is a little tricky.
The magnetic properties of a bar magnet, for instance, are
caused by the aligned rotation of the outermost orbiting
electrons of the atoms. In a mirror image, the direction of
rotation is reversed, say from clockwise to counterclockwise,
and so the magnetic field is reversed twice: once simply
because the whole picture is flipped and once because of the
reversed rotation of the electrons. In other words, magnetic
fields do not reverse themselves in a mirror image. We can
thus predict that there will be two possible types of
reflection of light waves. In one, the electric field is
inverted and the magnetic field uninverted. In the other,
the electric field is uninverted and the magnetic field inverted.

If you look at the front of a pair of high-quality
binoculars, you will notice a greenish-blue coating on the
lenses. This is advertised as a coating to prevent
reflection. Now reflection is clearly undesirable --- we
want the light to go \emph{in} the binoculars --- but so far
I've described reflection as an unalterable fact of nature,
depending only on the properties of the two wave media. The
coating can't change the speed of light in air or in glass,
so how can it work? The key is that the coating itself is a
wave medium. In other words, we have a three-layer sandwich
of materials: air, coating, and glass. We will analyze the
way the coating works, not because optical coatings are an
important part of your education but because it provides a
good example of the general phenomenon of wave interference effects.

There are two different interfaces between media: an
air-coating boundary and a coating-glass boundary. Partial
reflection and partial transmission will occur at each
boundary. For ease of visualization let's start by
considering an equivalent system consisting of three
dissimilar pieces of string tied together, and a wave
pattern consisting initially of a single pulse. Figure \figref{rope-with-three-parts}/1
shows the incident pulse moving through the heavy rope, in
which its velocity is low. When it encounters the lighter-weight
rope in the middle, a faster medium, it is partially
reflected and partially transmitted. (The transmitted pulse
is bigger, but nevertheless has only part of the original
energy.) The pulse transmitted by the first interface is
then partially reflected and partially transmitted by the
second boundary, 3. In figure 4, two pulses are on the
way back out to the left, and a single pulse is heading off
to the right. (There is still a weak pulse caught between
the two boundaries, and this will rattle back and forth,
rapidly getting too weak to detect as it leaks energy to the
outside with each partial reflection.)

Note how, of the two reflected pulses in 4, one is
inverted and one uninverted. One underwent reflection at
the first boundary (a reflection back into a slower medium
is uninverted), but the other was reflected at the second
boundary (reflection back into a faster medium is inverted).

Now let's imagine what would have happened if the incoming
wave pattern had been a long sinusoidal wave train instead
of a single pulse. The first two waves to reemerge on the
left could be in phase, \figref{inverted-sine-wave-trailing}/1, or out of phase, 2, or
anywhere in between. The amount of lag between them depends
entirely on the width of the middle segment of string. If we
choose the width of the middle string segment correctly,
then we can arrange for destructive interference to occur,
2, with cancellation resulting in a very weak reflected wave.

This whole analysis applies directly to our original case of
optical coatings. Visible light from most sources does
consist of a stream of short sinusoidal wave-trains such as
the ones drawn above. The only real difference between the
waves-on-a-rope example and the case of an optical coating
is that the first and third media are air and glass, in
which light does not have the same speed. However, the
general result is the same as long as the air and the glass
have light-wave speeds that either both greater than the
coating's or both less than the coating's.

The business of optical coatings turns out to be a very
arcane one, with a plethora of trade secrets and ``black
magic'' techniques handed down from master to apprentice.
Nevertheless, the ideas you have learned about waves in
general are sufficient to allow you to come to some definite
conclusions without any further technical knowledge. The
self-check and discussion questions will direct you along
these lines of thought.

changes gradually from one end to the other. What would you

\mysection{Waves Bounded on Both Sides}

In the examples discussed in section \ref{sec:interference-effects}, it was theoretically
true that a pulse would be trapped permanently in the middle
medium, but that pulse was not central to our discussion,
and in any case it was weakening severely with each partial
reflection. Now consider a guitar string. At its ends it is
tied to the body of the instrument itself, and since the
body is very massive, the behavior of the waves when they
reach the end of the string can be understood in the same
way as if the actual guitar string was attached on the ends
to strings that were extremely massive. Reflections are most
intense when the two media are very dissimilar. Because the
wave speed in the body is so radically different from the
speed in the string, we should expect nearly 100\% reflection.

<%
  fig(
    'period-of-pulse-on-guitar-SHARED',
    %q{The motion of a pulse on the string.}
  )
%>

<% end_marg %>
Although this may seem like a rather bizarre physical model
of the actual guitar string, it already tells us something
interesting about the behavior of a guitar that we would not
otherwise have understood. The body, far from being a
passive frame for attaching the strings to, is actually the
exit path for the wave energy in the strings. With every
reflection, the wave pattern on the string loses a tiny
fraction of its energy, which is then conducted through the
body and out into the air. (The string has too little
cross-section to make sound waves efficiently by itself.) By
changing the properties of the body, moreover, we should
expect to have an effect on the manner in which sound
escapes from the instrument. This is clearly demonstrated by
the electric guitar, which has an extremely massive, solid
wooden body. Here the dissimilarity between the two wave
media is even more pronounced, with the result that wave
energy leaks out of the string even more slowly. This is why
an electric guitar with no electric pickup can hardly be
heard at all, and it is also the reason why notes on an
electric guitar can be sustained for longer than notes
on an acoustic guitar.

If we initially create a disturbance on a guitar string, how
will the reflections behave? In reality, the finger or pick
will give the string a triangular shape before letting it
go, and we may think of this triangular shape as a very
broad ``dent'' in the string which will spread out in both
directions. For simplicity, however, let's just imagine a
wave pattern that initially consists of a single, narrow
pulse traveling up the neck, \figref{period-of-pulse-on-guitar}/1. After reflection from the
top end, it is inverted, 3. Now something interesting
happens: figure 5 is identical to figure 1. After two
reflections, the pulse has been inverted twice and has
changed direction twice. It is now back where it started.
The motion is periodic. This is why a guitar produces sounds
that have a definite sensation of pitch.

\begin{selfcheck}{guitar-period}
Notice that from \figref{period-of-pulse-on-guitar}/1 to \figref{period-of-pulse-on-guitar}/5, the pulse has passed by every
point on the string exactly twice. This means that the total
distance it has traveled equals $2L$, where $L$ is the
length of the string. Given this fact, what are the period
and frequency of the sound it produces, expressed in terms
of $L$ and $v$, the velocity of the wave?
\end{selfcheck}

Note that if the waves on the string obey the principle of
superposition, then the velocity must be independent of
amplitude, and the guitar will produce the same pitch
regardless of whether it is played loudly or softly. In
reality, waves on a string obey the principle of superposition
approximately, but not exactly. The guitar, like just about
any acoustic instrument, is a little out of tune when played
loudly. (The effect is more pronounced for wind instruments
than for strings, but wind players are able to compensate for it.)

%>
<% end_marg %>
Now there is only one hole in our reasoning. Suppose we
somehow arrange to have an initial setup consisting of two
identical pulses heading toward each other, as in figure
\figref{guitar-harmonic}. They will pass through each other, undergo a single
inverting reflection, and come back to a configuration in
which their positions have been exactly interchanged. This
means that the period of vibration is half as long. The
frequency is twice as high.

This might seem like a purely academic possibility, since
nobody actually plays the guitar with two picks at once! But
in fact it is an example of a very general fact about waves
that are bounded on both sides. \index{Fourier's theorem}A
mathematical theorem called Fourier's theorem states that
any wave can be created by superposing sine waves. Figure
\figref{fourier} shows how even by using only four sine
waves with appropriately chosen amplitudes, we can arrive at
a sum which is a decent approximation to the realistic
triangular shape of a guitar string being plucked. The
one-hump wave, in which half a wavelength fits on the
string, will behave like the single pulse we originally
discussed. We call its frequency $f_o$. The two-hump wave,
with one whole wavelength, is very much like the two-pulse
example. For the reasons discussed above, its frequency is
$2f_o$. Similarly, the three-hump and four-hump waves have
frequencies of $3f_o$ and $4f_o$.

Theoretically we would need to add together infinitely many
such wave patterns to describe the initial triangular shape
of the string exactly, although the amplitudes required for
the very high frequency parts would be very small, and an
excellent approximation could be achieved with as few as ten waves.

We thus arrive at the following very general conclusion.
Whenever a wave pattern exists in a medium bounded on both
sides by media in which the wave speed is very different,
the motion can be broken down into the motion of a
(theoretically infinite) series of sine waves, with
frequencies $f_\zu{o}$, $2f_\zu{o}$, $3f_\zu{o}$, ... Except for some
technical details, to be discussed below, this analysis
applies to a vast range of sound-producing systems,
including the air column within the human vocal tract.
Because sounds composed of this kind of pattern of
frequencies are so common, our ear-brain system has evolved
so as to perceive them as a single, fused sensation of tone.

\mysubsection[0]{Musical applications}

Many musicians claim to be able to pick out by ear
several of the frequencies $2f_\zu{o}$, $3f_\zu{o}$, ..., called
\index{overtones}overtones or \index{harmonics}\emph{harmonics} of the fundamental $f_\zu{o}$,\index{fundamental}
but they are kidding themselves. In reality, the overtone

individual overtones.

      of the overtones of G (x) are close to, but not right on top of, those of C\#.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
First, the relative strengths of the overtones is an
important part of the personality of a sound, called its
\index{timbre}timbre (rhymes with ``amber''). The
characteristic tone of the brass instruments, for example,
is a sound that starts out with a very strong harmonic
series extending up to very high frequencies, but whose
higher harmonics die down drastically as the attack changes
to the sustained portion of the note.

Second, although the ear cannot separate the individual
harmonics of a single musical tone, it is very sensitive to
clashes between the overtones of notes played simultaneously,
i.e., in harmony. We tend to perceive a combination of notes
as being dissonant if they have overtones that are close but
not the same. Roughly speaking, strong overtones whose
frequencies differ by more than 1\% and less than 10\% cause
the notes to sound dissonant. It is important to realize
that the term ``dissonance'' is not a negative one in music.
No matter how long you search the radio dial, you will never
hear more than three seconds of music without at least one
dissonant combination of notes. Dissonance is a necessary
ingredient in the creation of a musical cycle of tension and
release. Musically knowledgeable people don't use
the word ``dissonant'' as a criticism of music, although
dissonance can be used in a clumsy way, or without providing any contrast
between dissonance and consonance.

went to the bank. You might think that I and the person in
the photos had to practice for a long time in order to get
such nice sine waves. In fact, a sine wave is the only shape
that can create this kind of wave pattern, called a
\index{standing wave}standing wave, which simply vibrates
back and forth in one place without moving. The sine wave

\begin{eg}{Harmonics on string instruments}\label{eg:viola-harmonic}
Figure \figref{viola-harmonic} shows a violist playing what string players
refer to as a natural harmonic. The term ``harmonic'' is used here in a
somewhat different sense than in physics. The musician's pinkie
is pressing very lightly against the string --- not hard enough to
make it touch the fingerboard --- at a point precisely at the center
of the string's length. As shown in the diagram, this allows the string
to vibrate at frequencies $2f_\zu{o}, 4f_\zu{o}, 6f_\zu{o}, \ldots$, which have
stationary points at the center of the string, but not at
the odd multiples $f_\zu{o}, 3f_\zu{o}, \ldots$. Since all the
overtones are multiples of $2f_\zu{o}$, the ear perceives $2f_\zu{o}$ as
the basic frequency of the note. In musical terms, doubling the frequency
corresponds to raising the pitch by an octave. The technique can be used
in order to make it easier to play high notes in rapid passages, or for
its own sake, because of the change in timbre.
\end{eg}

If you think about it, it's not even obvious that sine waves
should be able to do this trick. After all, waves are
supposed to travel at a set speed, aren't they? The speed
isn't supposed to be zero! Well, we can actually think of a
standing wave as a superposition of a moving sine wave with
its own reflection, which is moving the opposite way. Sine
waves have the unique mathematical property that the sum of
sine waves of equal wavelength is simply a new sine wave
with the same wavelength. As the two sine waves go back and
forth, they always cancel perfectly at the ends, and their
sum appears to stand still.

\mysubsection[0]{Standing-wave patterns of air columns}

The air column inside a wind instrument or the human vocal
tract behaves very much like the wave-on-a-string example
we've been concentrating on so far, the main difference
being that we may have either inverting or noninverting
reflections at the ends.

\subsubsection{Inverting reflection at one end and noninverting at the other}


If you blow over the mouth of a beer bottle to produce a
tone, the bottle outlines an air column that is closed at
the bottom and open at the top. Sound waves will be
reflected at the bottom because of the difference in the
speed of sound in air and glass. The speed of sound is
greater in glass (because its stiffness more than compensates
for its higher density compared to air). Using the type of
reasoning outlined in optional section \ref{sec:quantitative-reflection}, we find that
this reflection will be density-noninverting: a compression
comes back as a compression, and a rarefaction as a
rarefaction. There will be strong reflection and very weak
transmission, since the difference in speeds is so great.
But why do we get a reflection at the \emph{mouth} of the
bottle? There is no change in medium there, and the air
inside the bottle is connected to the air in the room. This
is a type of reflection that has to do with the three-dimensional
shape of the sound waves, and cannot be treated the same way
as the other types of reflection we have encountered. Since
this chapter is supposed to be confined mainly to wave
motion in one dimension, and it would take us too far afield
here to explain it in detail, but the reason has to do with
readjustment of the wave pattern from a plane wave to a spherical
wave. If the readjustment was as sudden as that shown in the figure,
then there would be kinks in the wave. Waves don't like to develop
kinks. In section \ref{sec:quantitative-reflection} we deduced the strength of the reflected wave
at a change in medium from the requirement that the wave would not
have discontinuities or kinks. Here there is no change in medium, but
a reflected wave is still required in order to avoid kinks.

The important point is that whereas the reflection at the
bottom was density-noninverting, the one at the top is
density-inverting. This means that at the top of the bottle,
a compression superimposes with its own reflection, which is
a rarefaction. The two nearly cancel, and so the wave has
almost zero amplitude at the mouth of the bottle. The
opposite is true at the bottom --- here we have a peak in
the standing-wave pattern, not a stationary point. The
standing wave with the lowest frequency, i.e., the longest
wave length, is therefore one in which 1/4 of a wavelength
fits along the length of the tube, as shown in figure \figref{lowest-modes-of-air-column}/1.

\subsubsection{Both ends the same}

If both ends are open (as in the flute) or both ends closed
(as in some organ pipes), then the standing wave pattern
must be symmetric. The lowest-frequency wave fits half a
wavelength in the tube, \figref{lowest-modes-of-air-column}/2-3.

\begin{selfcheck}{fish-pattern}
Draw a graph of pressure versus position for the first
overtone of the air column in a tube open at one end and

possible wavelength that allows for a point of maximum
vibration at one end and a point of no vibration at the
other. How many times shorter will its wavelength be
compared to the frequency of the lowest-frequency standing
wave, shown in the figure? Based on this, how many times
greater will its frequency be?

\begin{summarytext}

Whenever a wave encounters the boundary between two media in
which its speeds are different, part of the wave is
reflected and part is transmitted. The reflection is always
reversed front-to-back, but may also be inverted in
amplitude. Whether the reflection is inverted depends on how
the wave speeds in the two media compare, e.g., a wave on a
string is uninverted when it is reflected back into a
segment of string where its speed is lower. The greater the
difference in wave speed between the two media, the greater
the fraction of the wave energy that is reflected.
Surprisingly, a wave in a dense material like wood will be
strongly reflected back into the wood at a wood-air boundary.

A one-dimensional wave confined by highly reflective
boundaries on two sides will display motion which is
periodic. For example, if both reflections are inverting,
the wave will have a period equal to twice the time required
to traverse the region, or to that time divided by an
integer. An important special case is a sinusoidal wave; in
this case, the wave forms a stationary pattern composed of a
superposition of sine waves moving in opposite direction.
