In chapter \ref{ch:circuits} we limited ourselves to relatively
simple circuits, essentially nothing more than a battery and
a single lightbulb. The purpose of this chapter is to
introduce you to more complex circuits, containing multiple
resistors or voltage sources in series, in parallel, or both.

Why do you need to know this stuff? After all, if you were
planning on being an electrical engineer you probably
wouldn't be learning physics from this book. Consider,
however, that every time you plug in a lamp or a radio you
are adding a circuit element to a household circuit and
making it more complex. Electrical safety, as well, cannot
really be understood without understanding multiple-element
circuits, since getting shocked usually involves at least
two parts: the device that is supposed to use power plus the
body of the person in danger. If you are a student majoring
in the life sciences, you should realize as well that all
cells are inherently electrical, and in any multicellular
organism there will therefore be various series and parallel circuits.

Even apart from these practical purposes, there is a very
fundamental reason for reading this chapter: to understand
 chapter \ref{ch:circuits} better. At this point in their studies,
I always observe students using words and modes of reasoning
that show they have not yet become completely comfortable
and fluent with the concepts of voltage and current. They
ask, ``aren't voltage and current sort of the same idea?''
They speak of voltage ``going through'' a lightbulb. Once
they begin honing their skills on more complicated circuits
I always see their confidence and understanding increase immeasurably.

	I see a chess position; Kasparov sees an interesting Ruy
	Lopez variation. To the uninitiated a schematic may look as
	unintelligible as Mayan hieroglyphs, but even a little bit
	of eye training can go a long way toward making its meaning
	leap off the page. A \index{schematic}schematic is a
	stylized and simplified drawing of a circuit. The purpose is
	to eliminate as many irrelevant features as possible, so
	that the relevant ones are easier to pick out.

	An example of an irrelevant feature is the physical shape,
	length, and diameter of a wire. In nearly all circuits, it
	is a good approximation to assume that the wires are perfect
	conductors, so that any piece of wire uninterrupted by other
	components has constant voltage throughout it. Changing the
	length of the wire, for instance, does not change this fact.
	(Of course if we used miles and miles of wire, as in a
	telephone line, the wire's resistance would start to add up,
	and its length would start to matter.) The shapes of the
	wires are likewise irrelevant, so we draw them with
	standardized, stylized shapes made only of vertical and
	horizontal lines with right-angle bends in them. This has
	the effect of making similar circuits look more alike and
	helping us to recognize familiar patterns, just as words in
	a newspaper are easier to recognize than handwritten ones.
	Figure \ref{fig:sample-schematics} shows some examples of these concepts.

	The most important first step in learning to read schematics
	is to learn to recognize contiguous pieces of wire which
	must have constant voltage throughout. In figure \ref{fig:constant-voltage-areas}, for
	example, the two shaded E-shaped pieces of wire must each
	have constant voltage. This focuses our attention on two of
	the main unknowns we'd like to be able to predict: the
	voltage of the left-hand E and the voltage of the one on the right.

 %%----------------------------------------------
\mysection[0]{Parallel resistances and the junction rule}
	\index{resistance!in parallel}\index{junction rule}

	One of the simplest examples to analyze is the parallel
	resistance circuit, of which figure \figref{constant-voltage-areas} was an example. In
	general we may have unequal resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$, as
	in \figref{parallel-resistors}/1. Since there are only two constant-voltage areas in
	the circuit, \figref{parallel-resistors}/2, all three components have the same voltage
	difference across them. A battery normally succeeds in
	maintaining the voltage differences across itself for which
	it was designed, so the voltage drops $\Delta V_1$ and
	$\Delta V_2$ across the resistors must both equal the
	voltage of the battery:
	\begin{equation*}
		\Delta V_1=\Delta V_2=\Delta V_{battery} \qquad   .
	\end{equation*}
	Each resistance thus feels the same voltage difference as if
	it was the only one in the circuit, and Ohm's law tells us
	that the amount of current flowing through each one is also
	the same as it would have been in a one-resistor circuit.
	This is why household electrical circuits are wired in
	parallel. We want every appliance to work the same,
	regardless of whether other appliances are plugged in or
	unplugged, turned on or switched off. (The electric company
	doesn't use batteries of course, but our analysis would be
	the same for any device that maintains a constant voltage.)

%>
	Of course the electric company can tell when we turn on
	every light in the house. How do they know? The answer is
	that we draw more current. Each resistance draws a certain
	amount of current, and the amount that has to be supplied is
	the sum of the two individual currents. The current is like
	a river that splits in half, \ref{fig:parallel-resistors}/3, and then reunites.
	The total current is
	\begin{equation*}
			I_{total}	 =    I_1 + I_2   \qquad   .  
	\end{equation*}

	This is an example of a general fact called the junction rule:

\begin{lessimportant}[the junction rule]
	In any circuit that is not storing or releasing charge, conservation of
	charge implies that the total current flowing out of any junction must be the
	same as the total flowing in.
\end{lessimportant}
	
	Coming back to the analysis of our circuit, we apply Ohm's
	law to each resistance, resulting in
	\begin{align*}
			I_{total}	 &=    \Delta V/R_1+ \Delta V/R_2  \\
				 &=    	 \Delta V\left(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)  \qquad   .  
	\end{align*}

	As far as the electric company is concerned, your whole
	house is just one resistor with some resistance $R$, called
	the \index{resistors!in parallel}\index{equivalent
	resistance!of resistors in parallel}\emph{equivalent resistance}.
	They would write Ohm's law as
	\begin{equation*}
				I_{total}	 =    \Delta V/R   \qquad   ,  
	\end{equation*}
	from which we can determine the equivalent resistance by
	comparison with the previous expression:
	\begin{align*}
				1/R	 &=   \frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}   \\
				  R	 &=  \left(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)^{-1} 	 
	\end{align*}
	\hfill{}[equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel]

	\noindent Two resistors in parallel, \ref{fig:parallel-resistors}/4, are equivalent to a single
	resistor with a value given by the above equation.

\begin{eg}{Two lamps on the same household circuit}
	\egquestion
	You turn on two lamps that are on the same
	household circuit. Each one has a resistance of 1 ohm. What
	is the equivalent resistance, and how does the power
	dissipation compare with the case of a single lamp?

	\eganswer
		The equivalent resistance of the two lamps in parallel is
	\begin{align*}
			 R	 &=    \left(\frac{1}{ R_1}+\frac{1}{ R_2}\right)^{-1}  \\
				 &=    \left(\frac{1}{1\ \Omega}+\frac{1}{1\ \Omega}\right)^{-1}  \\
				 &=    \left(1\ \Omega^{-1} + 1\ \Omega^{-1}\right)^{-1}  \\
				 &=    \left(2\ \Omega^{-1}\right)^{-1}  \\
				 &=    \text{0.5}\ \Omega   
	\end{align*}
	The voltage difference across the whole circuit is always
	the 110 V set by the electric company (it's alternating
	current, but that's irrelevant). The resistance of the whole
	circuit has been cut in half by turning on the second lamp,
	so a fixed amount of voltage will produce twice as much
	current. Twice the current flowing across the same voltage
	difference means twice as much power dissipation, which makes sense.

\end{eg}

	The cutting in half of the resistance surprises many
	students, since we are ``adding more resistance'' to the
	circuit by putting in the second lamp. Why does the
	equivalent resistance come out to be less than the
	resistance of a single lamp? This is a case where purely
	verbal reasoning can be misleading. A resistive circuit
	element, such as the filament of a lightbulb, is neither a
	perfect insulator nor a perfect conductor. Instead of
	analyzing this type of circuit in terms of ``resistors,''
	i.e., partial insulators, we could have spoken of ``conductors.''
	This example would then seem reasonable, since we ``added
	more conductance,'' but one would then have the incorrect
	expectation about the case of resistors in series, discussed
	in the following section.

	Perhaps a more productive way of thinking about it is to use
	mechanical intuition. By analogy, your nostrils resist the
	flow of air through them, but having two nostrils makes it
	twice as easy to breathe.

	\begin{eg}{Three resistors in parallel}
	\egquestion
	What happens if we have three or more resistors in parallel?

	\eganswer
		This is an important example, because the solution
	involves an important technique for understanding circuits:
	breaking them down into smaller parts and them simplifying
	those parts. In the circuit \ref{fig:eg-three-resistors-in-parallel}/1, with three resistors in
	parallel, we can think of two of the resistors as forming a
	single resistor, \ref{fig:eg-three-resistors-in-parallel}/2, with equivalent resistance 
	\begin{equation*}
			 R_{12}	 =    \left(\frac{1}{ R_1}+\frac{1}{ R_2}\right)^{-1}   \qquad   .  
	\end{equation*}
	We can then simplify the circuit as shown in \ref{fig:eg-three-resistors-in-parallel}/3, so that it
	contains only two resistances. The equivalent resistance of
	the whole circuit is then given by
	\begin{equation*}
			 R_{123}    =    \left(\frac{1}{ R_{12}}+\frac{1}{ R_3}\right)^{-1}   \qquad   .  
	\end{equation*}
	Substituting for $R_{12}$ and simplifying, we find the result
	\begin{equation*}
			 R_{123}    =  \left(\frac{1}{ R_1}+\frac{1}{ R_2}+\frac{1}{ R_3}\right)^{-1}     \qquad   ,  
	\end{equation*}
	which you probably could have guessed. The interesting point
	here is the divide-and-conquer concept, not the mathematical result.

\end{eg}
\begin{eg}{An arbitrary number of identical resistors in parallel}
	\egquestion
	What is the resistance of $N$ identical resistors in parallel?

	\eganswer
		Generalizing the results for two and three resistors, we have
	\begin{equation*}
			 R_{N}	 =   \left(\frac{1}{ R_1}+\frac{1}{ R_2}+\ldots\right)^{-1}    \qquad   ,  
	\end{equation*}
	where ``...'' means that the sum includes all the resistors.
	If all the resistors are identical, this becomes
	\begin{align*}
			 R_{N}	 &=  \left(\frac{ N}{ R}\right)^{-1}    \\
				 &=     \frac{ R}{ N} 
	\end{align*}

\end{eg}
\begin{eg}{Dependence of resistance on cross-sectional area}
	We have alluded briefly to the fact that an object's
	electrical resistance depends on its size and shape, but now
	we are ready to begin making more mathematical statements
	about it. As suggested by figure \ref{fig:eg-cross-sectional-area}, increasing a
	resistors's cross-sectional area is equivalent to adding
	more resistors in parallel, which will lead to an overall
	decrease in resistance. Any real resistor with straight,
	parallel sides can be sliced up into a large number of
	pieces, each with cross-sectional area of, say, 1 $\mu \zu{m}^2$.
	The number, $N$, of such slices is proportional to the total
	cross-sectional area of the resistor, and by application of
	the result of the previous example we therefore find that
	the resistance of an object is inversely proportional to its
	cross-sectional area.

		An analogous relationship holds for water pipes, which is

<% end_marg %>

\begin{eg}{Incorrect readings from a voltmeter}
		A voltmeter is really just an ammeter with an internal
	resistor, and we use a voltmeter in parallel with the thing
	that we're trying to measure the voltage difference across.
	This means that any time we measure the voltage drop across
	a resistor, we're essentially putting two resistors in
	parallel. The ammeter inside the voltmeter can be ignored
	for the purpose of analyzing what how current flows in the
	circuit, since it is essentially just some coiled-up wire
	with a very low resistance.

		Now if we are carrying out this measurement on a resistor
	that is part of a larger circuit, we have changed the
	behavior of the circuit through our act of measuring. It is
	as though we had modified the circuit by replacing the
	resistance $R$ with the smaller equivalent resistance of $R$
	and $R_v$ in parallel. It is for this reason that voltmeters
	are built with the largest possible internal resistance. As
	a numerical example, if we use a voltmeter with an internal
	resistance of 1 $M\Omega $ to measure the voltage drop
	across a one-ohm resistor, the equivalent resistance is
	0.999999 $\Omega $, which is not different enough to make
	any difference. But if we tried to use the same voltmeter to
	measure the voltage drop across a $2-M\Omega $ resistor, we
	would be reducing the resistance of that part of the circuit
	by a factor of three, which would produce a drastic change
	in the behavior of the whole circuit.
\end{eg}

		This is the reason why you can't use a voltmeter to measure
	the voltage difference between two different points in
	mid-air, or between the ends of a piece of wood. This is by
	no means a stupid thing to want to do, since the world
	around us is not a constant-voltage environment, the most
	extreme example being when an electrical storm is brewing.
	But it will not work with an ordinary voltmeter because the
	resistance of the air or the wood is many gigaohms. The
	effect of waving a pair of voltmeter probes around in the
	air is that we provide a reuniting path for the positive and
	negative charges that have been separated --- through the
	voltmeter itself, which is a good conductor compared to the
	air. This reduces to zero the voltage difference we
	were trying to measure.

		In general, a voltmeter that has been set up with an open
	circuit (or a very large resistance) between its probes is
	said to be ``floating.'' An old-fashioned analog voltmeter
	of the type described here will read zero when left
	floating, the same as when it was sitting on the shelf. A
	floating digital voltmeter usually shows an error message.

\mysection[0]{Series resistances}\index{resistance!in series}

	The two basic circuit layouts are parallel and series, so a
	pair of resistors in series, \ref{fig:seriesresistors}/1, is another of the most
	basic circuits we can make. By conservation of charge, all
	the current that flows through one resistor must also flow
	through the other (as well as through the battery):
	\begin{equation*}
			I_1    =    I_2   \qquad   .  
	\end{equation*}
	The only way the information about the two resistance values
	is going to be useful is if we can apply Ohm's law, which
	will relate the resistance of each resistor to the current
	flowing through it and the voltage difference across it.
	Figure \ref{fig:seriesresistors}/2 shows the three constant-voltage areas. Voltage
	differences are more physically significant than voltages,
	so we define symbols for the voltage differences across the
	two resistors in figure \ref{fig:seriesresistors}/3.

<% end_marg %>
	We have three constant-voltage areas, with symbols for the
	difference in voltage between every possible pair of them.
	These three voltage differences must be related to each
	other. It is as though I tell you that Fred is a foot taller
	than Ginger, Ginger is a foot taller than Sally, and Fred is
	two feet taller than Sally. The information is redundant,
	and you really only needed two of the three pieces of data
	to infer the third. In the case of our voltage differences, we have
	\begin{equation*}
		   |\Delta V_1| + |\Delta V_2| = |\Delta V_{battery}| \qquad   .
	\end{equation*}
	The absolute value signs are because of the ambiguity in how
	we define our voltage differences. If we reversed the two
	probes of the voltmeter, we would get a result with the
	opposite sign. Digital voltmeters will actually provide a
	minus sign on the screen if the wire connected to the ``V''
	plug is lower in voltage than the one connected to the
	``COM'' plug. Analog voltmeters pin the needle against a peg
	if you try to use them to measure negative voltages, so you
	have to fiddle to get the leads connected the right way, and
	then supply any necessary minus sign yourself.

	Figure \ref{fig:seriesresistors}/4 shows a standard way of taking care of the
	ambiguity in signs. For each of the three voltage measurements
	around the loop, we keep the same probe (the darker one) on
	the clockwise side. It is as though the voltmeter was
	sidling around the circuit like a crab, without ever
	``crossing its legs.'' With this convention, the relationship
	among the voltage drops becomes
	\begin{equation*}
		  \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2 = -\Delta V_{battery} \qquad   ,
	\end{equation*}
	or, in more symmetrical form,
	\begin{equation*}
		  \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2 + \Delta V_{battery} = 0\qquad   .
	\end{equation*}
	More generally, this is known as the loop rule for analyzing circuits:

\begin{lessimportant}[the loop rule]
	Assuming the standard convention for plus and minus signs, the sum of the
	voltage drops around any closed loop in a circuit must be zero.
\end{lessimportant}

	Looking for an exception to the \index{loop rule}loop rule
	would be like asking for a hike that would be downhill all
	the way and that would come back to its starting point!

		For the circuit we set out to analyze, the equation
	\begin{equation*}
		  \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2 + \Delta V_{battery} = 0
	\end{equation*}
	can now be rewritten by applying Ohm's law to each resistor:
	\begin{equation*}
		  I_1R_1 + I_2R_2 + \Delta V_{battery} = 0 \qquad .
	\end{equation*}
	The currents are the same, so we can factor them out:
	\begin{equation*}
		  I\left(R_1 + R_2\right) + \Delta V_{battery} = 0 \qquad ,
	\end{equation*}
	and this is the same result we would have gotten if we had
	been analyzing a one-resistor circuit with resistance
	$R_1+R_2$. Thus the equivalent resistance of resistors in
	series equals the sum of their resistances.

	\egquestion
	If two identical  lightbulbs are placed in series,
	how do their brightnesses compare with the brightness of a single bulb?

	\eganswer
		Taken as a whole, the pair of bulbs act like a
	doubled resistance, so they will draw half as much current
	from the wall. Each bulb will be dimmer than a single
	bulb would have been.

The total power dissipated by the circuit is $I\Delta V$.
	The voltage drop across the whole circuit is the same as
	before, but the current is halved, so the two-bulb circuit
	draws half as much total power as the one-bulb circuit. Each
	bulb draws one-quarter of the normal power.

		Roughly speaking, we might expect this to result in one
	quarter the light being produced by each bulb, but in
	reality lightbulbs waste quite a high percentage of their
	power in the form of heat and wavelengths of light that are
	not visible (infrared and ultraviolet). Less light will be

\begin{eg}{Dependence of resistance on length}
	In the previous section, we proved that resistance is

	harder to blow through a long straw than through a short one.

		Putting the two arguments together, we find that the
	resistance of an object with straight, parallel sides is given by
	\begin{equation*}
				 R    =    \text{(constant)} \cdot  L/ A  
	\end{equation*}
	The proportionality constant is called the \index{resistivity!defined}resistivity,
	and it depends only on the substance of which the object is
	made. A resistivity measurement could be used, for instance,
	to help identify a sample of an unknown substance.

\begin{eg}{Choice of high voltage for power lines}\label{hvtransmission}
		Thomas Edison got involved in a famous technological
	controversy over the voltage difference that should be used
	for electrical power lines. At this time, the public was
	unfamiliar with electricity, and easily scared by it. The
	president of the United States, for instance, refused to
	have electrical lighting in the White House when it first
	became commercially available because he considered it
	unsafe, preferring the known fire hazard of oil lamps to the
	mysterious dangers of electricity. Mainly as a way to
	overcome public fear, Edison believed that power should be
	transmitted using small voltages, and he publicized his
	opinion by giving demonstrations at which a dog was lured
	into position to be killed by a large voltage difference
	between two sheets of metal on the ground. (Edison's
	opponents also advocated alternating current rather than
	direct current, and AC is more dangerous than DC as well. As
	we will discuss later, AC can be easily stepped up and down
	to the desired voltage level using a device called a transformer.)

			Now if we want to deliver a certain amount of power $P_L$ to
	a load such as an electric lightbulb, we are constrained
	only by the equation $P_{L} =  I\Delta  V_L$. We can deliver any
	amount of power we wish, even with a low voltage, if we are
	willing to use large currents. Modern electrical distribution
	networks, however, use dangerously high voltage differences
	of tens of thousands of volts. Why did Edison lose the debate?  

		It boils down to money. The electric company must deliver
	the amount of power $P_L$ desired by the customer through a
	transmission line whose resistance $R_T$ is fixed by
	economics and geography. The same current flows through both
	the load and the transmission line, dissipating power
	usefully in the former and wastefully in the latter. The
	efficiency of the system is
	\begin{align*}
			\text{efficiency}	 &=   \frac{\text{power paid for by the customer}}
										{\text{power paid for by the utility}}   \\
					 &=  \frac{ P_{L}}{ P_L+ P_{T}}    \\
					 &=   \frac{1}{1+ P_{T}/ P_L}   
	\end{align*}
	Putting ourselves in the shoes of the electric company, we
	wish to get rid of the variable $P_T$, since it is something
	we control only indirectly by our choice of $\Delta  V_T$ and
	$I$. Substituting $P_{T}= I\Delta  V_T$, we find
	\begin{equation*}
			\text{efficiency}	 =      \frac{1}
							{1+\frac{ I \Delta V_T}{ P_L}}
	\end{equation*}
	We assume the transmission line (but not necessarily the
	load) is ohmic, so substituting $\Delta V_T=IR_T$ gives
	\begin{equation*}
			efficiency	 =      \frac{1}{1+\frac{I^2R_T}{P_L}}
	\end{equation*}
	This quantity can clearly be maximized by making $I$ as
	small as possible, since we will then be dividing by the
	smallest possible quantity on the bottom of the fraction. A
	low-current circuit can only deliver significant amounts of
	power if it uses high voltages, which is why electrical
	transmission systems use dangerous high voltages.

\begin{eg}{Getting killed by your ammeter}
		As with a voltmeter, an ammeter can give erroneous readings
	if it is used in such a way that it changes the behavior the
	circuit. An ammeter is used in series, so if it is used to
	measure the current through a resistor, the resistor's value
	will effectively be changed to $R+ R_a$, where $R_a$ is the
	resistance of the ammeter. Ammeters are designed with very
	low resistances in order to make it unlikely that $R+ R_a$
	will be significantly different from $R$.
\end{eg}

		In fact, the real hazard is death, not a wrong reading!
	Virtually the only circuits whose resistances are significantly
	less than that of an ammeter are those designed to carry
	huge currents. An ammeter inserted in such a circuit can
	easily melt. When I was working at a laboratory funded by
	the Department of Energy, we got periodic bulletins from the
	DOE safety office about serious accidents at other sites,
	and they held a certain ghoulish fascination. One of these
	was about a DOE worker who was completely incinerated by the
	explosion created when he inserted an ordinary Radio Shack
	ammeter into a high-current circuit. Later estimates showed
	that the heat was probably so intense that the explosion was
	a ball of plasma --- a gas so hot that its atoms have been ionized.

\begin{dq}
	We have stated the loop rule in a symmetric form where a
	series of voltage drops adds up to zero. To do this, we had
	to define a standard way of connecting the voltmeter to the
	circuit so that the plus and minus signs would come out
	right. Suppose we wish to restate the junction rule in a
	similar symmetric way, so that instead of equating the
	current coming in to the current going out, it simply states
	that a certain sum of currents at a junction adds up to
	zero. What standard way of inserting the ammeter would we
	have to use to make this work?
\end{dq}

\begin{summary}

\begin{summarytext}[]

A schematic is a drawing of a circuit that standardizes and
stylizes its features to make it easier to understand. Any
circuit can be broken down into smaller parts. For instance,
one big circuit may be understood as two small circuits in
series, another as three circuits in parallel. When circuit
elements are combined in parallel and in series, we have two
basic rules to guide us in understanding how the parts
function as a whole:

\begin{indentedblock}
\noindent\textbf{the junction rule:} In any circuit that is not storing or
releasing charge, conservation of charge implies that the
total current flowing out of any junction must be the same
as the total flowing in.

\noindent\textbf{the loop rule:} Assuming the standard convention for plus and
minus signs, the sum of the voltage drops around any closed
loop in a circuit must be zero.
\end{indentedblock}

The simplest application of these rules is to pairs of
resistors combined in series or parallel. In such cases, the
pair of resistors acts just like a single unit with a
certain resistance value, called their equivalent resistance.
Resistances in series add to produce a larger equivalent resistance,
\begin{equation*}
  R_{series} = R_1+R_2 \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
because the current has to fight its way through both
resistances. Parallel resistors combine to produce an
equivalent resistance that is smaller than either individual resistance,
\begin{equation*}
 R_{parallel} = \left(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)^{-1}\qquad ,
\end{equation*}
because the current has two different paths open to it.

An important example of resistances in parallel and series
is the use of voltmeters and ammeters in resistive circuits.
A voltmeter acts as a large resistance in parallel with the
resistor across which the voltage drop is being measured.
The fact that its resistance is not infinite means that it
alters the circuit it is being used to investigate,
producing a lower equivalent resistance. An ammeter acts as
a small resistance in series with the circuit through which
the current is to be determined. Its resistance is not quite
zero, which leads to an increase in the resistance of the
circuit being tested.
