This project depended on a mind-boggling amount of free software. Among the
people who should be thanked for writing this software are Donald Knuth,
Leslie Lamport, Han The Thanh, Petr Sojka, Jiri Zlatuska, Thomas Esser,
Gerben Wierda, Richard Koch, J\'er\^ome Laurens, and Dirk Olmes, as well
as the many other people who contributed to the LaTeX project and BSD Unix.
Thanks to Tobias Oetiker, Hubert Partl, Irene Hyna, and Elisabeth Schlegl
for making \emph{The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e} available for free.
David Raymond and Richard Koch provided valuable help getting me started
with LaTeX. Donald Arseneau helped me to whip my sans serif math into
shape.
