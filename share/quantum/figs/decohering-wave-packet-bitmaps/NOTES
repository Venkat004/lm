WP offers multiple definitions of coherence length. The one the program
outputs is L = c/Delta f = 2pi/Delta k. This comes out inconveniently
large for my diagrams, so the arrows on the diagram are drawn to be
precisely half this length.

The wavelength of the molecules in Eibenberger was about 500 fm, so
in fact the molecule was about 10^4 times larger in size than its
wavelength.
