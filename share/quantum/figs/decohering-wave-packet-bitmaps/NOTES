WP offers multiple definitions of coherence length. The one the program
outputs is L = c/Delta f = 2pi/Delta k. This is the length of the arrows
in the diagram.

The wavelength of the molecules in Eibenberger was about 500 fm, so
in fact the molecule was about 10^4 times larger in size than its
wavelength.

There is another set of figures generated by the same script, used
in the figure called coherence, in SN 12 (optics). The wavelengths
and coherence lengths in those figures are double what they are in
this version, and the want_envelope flag was turned off.
