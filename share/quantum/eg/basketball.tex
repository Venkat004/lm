\begin{eg}{Looking for tall basketball players}\label{eg:basketball}
\egquestion A certain country with a large population wants to
find very tall people to be on its Olympic basketball team
and strike a blow against western imperialism. Out of a pool
of $10^8$  people who are the right age and gender, how many
are they likely to find who are over 225 cm (7 feet 4 inches) in
height? Figure \figref{human-height-tail} gives a close-up of the ``tail'' of the
distribution shown previously in figure \figref{human-height}.

\eganswer The shaded area under the curve represents the
probability that a given person is tall enough. Each
rectangle represents a probability of
$0.2\times10^{-7}\ \zu{cm}^{-1} \times 1\ \zu{cm}=2\times10^{-8}$.
 There are about 35
rectangles covered by the shaded area, so the probability of
having a height greater than 225 cm is $7\times10^{-7}$ , or
just under one in a million. Using the rule for calculating
averages, the average, or expected number of people this
tall is $(10^8)\times(7\times10^{-7})=70$.
