People sometimes say that quantum mechanics is the set of rules for
describing the world of the very small, but this is a false
generalization, like saying that terriers are untrainable. How do we
define our measure of how small is small? The only distance scales
we've discussed have been wavelengths, and there is no upper limit on
wavelengths. The wavelength of an FM radio photon is bigger than my
terrier, who is very obedient to Newton's laws.  The only scale built
in to the structure of quantum mechanics is Planck's constant, and
Planck's constant has units of joules per hertz, not meters, so it
can't be converted into a distance. Quantum mechanics is, as far as we
can tell, a valid tool for describing systems at scales from
quarks to galaxies.

So quantum behavior can occur at any scale, even large ones. For an example
that may be a little disturbing, consider the arrangement shown in figure
\figref{beam-splitter}.  A single photon comes
in from the left and encounters a diagonal piece of glass. The glass reflects half
the light and transmits half of it. The photon is a wave, and this is expected wave
behavior. But the photon is also a particle, and we can't have half a particle.
Therefore either camera A will detect a whole photon and B will see none, or it
will be the other way around. If we repeat the experiment many times times, we might
come up with a list of results like this:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
A & B \\
\hline
no & yes \\
yes & no \\
yes & no \\
no & yes \\
no & yes \\
yes & no \\
no & yes \\
yes & no 
\end{tabular}

\noindent There is no discernible pattern. The results appear random. 
There is no limit in principle on how far away the two cameras can be
placed.  (Real-world experiments of this type have been done over
distances of a thousand kilometers, with the photons traveling either
through outer space or through fiber-optic cables.)

What we \emph{never} observe is an outcome in which both A and B detect
a photon, or one in which neither detects it. That is, the occurrence
of event A (camera A sees a photon) and event B (camera B sees one)
are both random, but they are not independent. Intuitively this may
seem as though there is some sort of conspiracy being carried out
over arbitrarily large distances and with no time delay. It
seems as though the two parts of the wave are like a pair of
criminal suspects who would like to line up their stories but are
being kept in separate jail cells so that they can't communicate.  If
the part of the wave at A is going to be detected (at full strength,
carrying 100\% of the energy $E=hf$), how does the part
at B get the message that it had better not be detected, fading away
like the Cheshire cat? Einstein derisively referred to this apparent coordination
as ``spooky action at a distance.''

Niels Bohr and two collaborators proposed in 1924 the
seemingly reasonable solution that there \emph{can't} be any such
coordination. Then the random detection of the photon by camera A
and camera B would be independent. Independent probabilities multiply,
so there would be a probability of $(1/2)(1/2)=1/4$ that both cameras
would see photons. This would violate conservation of energy, since
the original energy $E=hf$ would have been detected twice, and the universe
would have gained $1hf$ worth of total energy. But Bohr
pointed out that there would also be the same probability that neither
camera would detect a photon, in which case the change in the universe's
energy would be $-1hf$. On the average, energy would be conserved. According
to Bohr's theory, conservation of energy and momentum would not be absolute
laws of physics but only rules that would be true on the average.

The experimentalists Geiger and Bothe immediately set out to test this
prediction. They performed an experiment analogous to the one in
figure \figref{beam-splitter}, but with x-rays rather than visible
light.  Their results, published in 1926, showed that if one detector
saw the x-ray photon, the other did not, so that energy was always
conserved at the microscopic level, not just on the average.

At a 1927 conference in Brussels, Einstein protested that this was a
problem, because the two detectors could in principle make their
observations simultaneously, and it would then seem that some
influence or communication was being transmitted between them faster
than the speed of light.  ``It seems to me,'' he complained, ''that
this difficulty cannot be overcome unless the description of the
process in terms of the \ldots wave is supplemented by some detailed
specification of the [trajectory of the particle]. \ldots If one works
only with \ldots waves, the interpretation \ldots, I think,
contradicts the postulate of relativity.''

The experimental fact ends up being that the spooky action at a
distance exists, and it does go faster than light. In 2012, Guerreiro
\emph{et al.}\footnote{\url{arxiv.org/abs/1204.1712}. The paper is
very readable.} carried out a very direct and conceptually simple
enactment of exactly the experiment in figure \figref{beam-splitter},
with electronic timing precise enough to prove that the detection
events at A and B were separated from each other by too great a
distance to have been linked by any influence traveling at $\le c$.
These findings are summarized by saying that quantum mechanics is
\emph{nonlocal}.  A single wave-particle can have be spread out over
an arbitrarily large region of space, but its interactions that
transfer energy and momentum are always correlated over these
distances in such a way that the conservation laws are maintained. 

What Einstein had not originally appreciated was that these
correlations do not violate relativity because they do not actually
transport any energy, or even any information, between A and B. For
example, if Alice is at detector A, and Bob is at B, a million
kilometers away, Alice can detect the photon and know immediately that
Bob did not detect it. She learns something seemingly instantaneously
about Bob --- Bob is probably sad and disappointed right now. But
because Bob does not have any control over the result, he cannot use
this fact to send a message to Alice, so there is no transmission of
information.

As a useful analogy, suppose that you head off to work on a winter day
in New York. As you step out of the subway station into the cold air,
you reach into your coat pockets for your gloves, but you find that
you only have your left glove. Oh, you must have dropped your right
glove while you were petting your adorable terrier on the way out the
door. The presence of your left glove tells you that your right glove
must be lying on the floor by the front door. But there has been no
spooky action at a distance. You have simply recovered some
information about a region of space that lies at some distance from
you.

Everything I've said so far in this section has been a matter of objective
facts. But it's natural at this point to see if we can form a better
mental picture of what's going on. Einstein and Bohr had strong physical
intuitions that led them to incorrect predictions about experiments, and
these predictions were the fruits of inappropriate mental pictures. The
picture we will adopt instead is the following. Before the photon hits the glass
diagonal, the state of things is the following.
\begin{equation*}
\fbox{\parbox{60mm}{A photon is headed to the right.}}
\end{equation*}
Our photon is then partially reflected and partially transmitted. Now we have
a superposition of two wave patterns:
\begin{equation*}
 c\fbox{\parbox{35mm}{The photon has been reflected upward.}}
+c'\fbox{\parbox{35mm}{The photon has continue to the right.}},
\end{equation*}
where the amplitudes $c$ and $c'$ are equal in absolute value.\footnote{
Conservation of energy requires $c^2=1/2$ and $c'^2=1/2$,
even in classical physics. We could have, for
example, $c=1/\sqrt{2}$ and $c'=-1/\sqrt{2}$. Such a possible difference in
signs wouldn't concern us in this example. It would only be relevant if there
were some later opportunity for the two parts of the wave to recombine and
superimpose on one another, producing interference effects.}
Let's say that the cameras are at equal distances from the glass diagonal,
so that their chances to detect the photon occur simultaneously.\footnote{
According to special relativity, this simultaneity holds only in one frame
of reference, say the lab frame. But if simultaneity does hold in one frame,
then we can also say that in \emph{all} frames, the distance between the two
events is ``spacelike,'' i.e., they are too far apart to have been connected
by any causal influence propagating at $\le c$.
}
After detection, we have this:
\begin{equation*}
 c\fbox{\parbox{35mm}{Camera A detected a photon and B didn't.}}
+c'\fbox{\parbox{35mm}{B detected a photon and A didn't.}},
\end{equation*}
Here we have made the nontrivial assumption that material objects like
cameras obey the same wave-superposition rules as photons. This turns out
to be true. Cameras are made out of things like electrons,
and as we'll see in __section_or_chapter(matter-as-a-wave), things like
electrons are also wave-particles, and they obey all the same wave-particle rules
as photons.

You can see where this is headed.  Alice had been standing by camera A,
watching anxiously, while Bob, a million kilometers away, was
breathlessly observing camera B. 
\begin{equation*}
 c\fbox{\parbox{35mm}{Alice saw a photon and Bob didn't. They consider this result to have been random.}}
+c'\fbox{\parbox{35mm}{Bob saw a photon and Alice didn't. They consider this result to have been random.}},
\end{equation*}
It doesn't \emph{seem} to Alice and Bob as though their brains are in
a superposition of two states. They \emph{feel} as though they have only
experienced the one possibility that actually happened, not a mixture of
both at the same time. And yet this cartoon of the physics explains very nicely
how the deterministic laws of physics produces a result that \emph{seems}
to them to have been random.

One could object that we are not free to adopt this description as a
useful cartoon, without considering its testable consequences. If
Alice and Bob have been split into two ghostlike halves of themselves,
then conceivably these half-selves could undergo interference, as in
the double-slit experiment. But there are practical reasons why we
cannot actually detect such interference effects. For one thing, Alice
and Bob are macroscopic objects, with energies $E$ on the order of
many joules. Because Planck's constant is small, their wave
frequencies $f=E/h$ are extremely high, and their wavelengths
incredibly short (on the order of $10^{-34}\ \munit$!). We have seen
that diffraction becomes undetectable when wavelengths are too short.
Furthermore, there is a phenomenon called decoherence, in which
interactions with the environment tend to rapidly randomize the
wave-phases of large objects. When phases are randomized, interference and diffraction
effects become undetectable.
