1.~\emph{Positivity:} Probabilities are positive.

2.~\emph{Normalization:} The total probability is 1.

3.~\emph{Additivity:} Mutually exclusive probabilities are additive.

4.~\emph{Independence:} Independent systems obey the definition of statistical independence,
        i.e., their probabilities multiply.

5.~\emph{The weak law of large numbers:} In the limit of a large number of trials, the frequency of a certain
         event converges to its probability.

{\footnotesize Statements 1-3 are called the Kolmogorov axioms. In 3, for technical reasons,
``additive'' is usually taken to include infinite sums, such as $1+1/2+1/4+\ldots$,
but not continuous sums such as integrals. Statement 4 is prediction about experiment.
Statement 5 can be considered to be either a theorem to be proved from axioms such
as 1-3, or an operational definition of probability, or a prediction about experiments.}
