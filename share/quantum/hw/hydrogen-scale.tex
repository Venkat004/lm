(a) A distance scale is shown below the wavefunctions and
probability densities illustrated in 
figure \figref{hydrogen-three-states} on page \pageref{fig:hydrogen-three-states}.
Compare this with the order-of-magnitude estimate derived in subsection
\ref{subsec:hydrogen-energies} for the radius $r$ at which the wavefunction begins
tailing off. Was the estimate on the right
order of magnitude?\hwendpart
(b) Although we normally say the moon
orbits the earth, actually they both orbit around their
common center of mass, which is below the earth's surface
but not at its center. The same is true of the hydrogen
atom. Does the center of mass lie inside the proton, or outside it?\hwendpart
