This problem refers to the analysis of the ammonia molecule in
sec.~\ref{subsec:qm-ammonia}, p.~\pageref{subsec:qm-ammonia}. 
(a) The text constructs the ground state $|\text{g.s.}\rangle$, which has energy $-|\fmat|=\fmat$. Use the
same method to find the excited state, which has energy $+|\fmat|=-\fmat$.\\
(b) Verify that these two states are orthogonal.\\
(c) Find normalized versions of the two states.
