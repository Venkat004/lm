In section \ref{subsec:s-eqn-cut-and-paste}, p.~\pageref{subsec:s-eqn-cut-and-paste},
we found the solution to the Schr\"odinger
equation for a particle arriving at a potential barrier, in the case where the
far side of the barrier is classically allowed. We now consider the case in which
the barrier is not just high enough to make the region beyond it classically
forbidden --- we let the height of the barrier be infinite. Let the potential
be
\begin{equation*}
  U(x) = \begin{cases}
    0, & x< 0 \\
    +\infty, & x> 0,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
and let the incident wave be
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi_\zu{I} = e^{i(kx-\omega t)} \qquad \text{($x< 0$)}.
\end{equation*}
Determine the form of the complete solution to the Schr\"odinger
equation on the left side of the barrier, including both
the incident wave and the reflected wave.\answercheck
