Suppose that an electron, in one dimension, is confined to a certain region
of space so that its wavefunction is given by
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi = 
  \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if } x<0 \\
    A \sin(2\pi x/L) & \text{if } 0\le x\le L \\
    0 & \text{if } x>L 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Determine the constant $A$ from normalization.\answercheck
