In the SI, we have three base units, the kilogram, the meter, and the second.
From these, we form expressions such as $\munit/\sunit$ to represent units
of velocity, and $\kgunit\unitdot\munit/\sunit^2$ for force. Show that these
expressions form a vector space with the rational numbers as the scalars.
What operation on the units should we take as the ``addition'' operation?
What operation should scalar ``multiplication'' be?
