In problem \ref{hw:quantumho} on p.~\pageref{hw:quantumho}, you showed that a wavefunction of the form
\begin{equation*}
\Psi_0(x)=e^{-x^2/2}
\end{equation*}
was a solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the quantum harmonic oscillator in
one dimensions. (We ignore units, and the factor of 1/2 in the exponent is just a convention.)
It represents the ground state. The wavefunction of the first
excited state is
\begin{equation*}
\Psi_1(x)=xe^{-x^2/2},
\end{equation*}
with the same value of $b$.\\
(a) Show that these states are orthogonal in the sense defined 
on p.~\pageref{orthogonal-wavefunctions}.\hwendpart
(b) What is an observable that would distinguish them?
