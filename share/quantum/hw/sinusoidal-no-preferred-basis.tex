Consider the wavefunctions
\begin{align*}
  \Psi_1 &= e^{ikx}, \\
  \Psi_2 &= e^{-ikx}, \\
  \Phi_1 &= \cos kx, \qquad \text{and} \\
  \Phi_2 &= i\sin kx.
\end{align*}
Show that $\Psi_1=\Phi_1+\Phi_2$. Similarly,
express $\Psi_2$ in terms of the $\Phi$'s,
and express each of the $\Phi$'s in terms of
the $\Psi$'s. Relate this to the principle that
there is no preferred basis in quantum mechanics (p.~\pageref{no-preferred-basis}).\answercheck
