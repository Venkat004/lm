In example \ref{eg:moat-orthogonal-traveling-waves} on p.~\pageref{eg:moat-orthogonal-traveling-waves},
we defined wavefunctions for the traveling-wave solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation
in a ``quantum moat,'' and calculated the inner product
$\langle \text{ccw} | \text{cw} \rangle=0$ to verify that the counterclockwise and clockwise
traveling waves were orthogonal, as must be the case for distinguishable states.
Let's now define standing-wave versions $|\text{c}\rangle = \cos\theta$
and $|\text{s}\rangle = \sin\theta$. Verify by direct calculation that 
$\langle \text{c} | \text{s} \rangle=0$.
\hwremark{Note that, as discussed in the sidebar on p.~\pageref{fig:phase-and-norm-not-observable},
this does not contradict the principle that a quantum-mechanical phase is undetectable.}
