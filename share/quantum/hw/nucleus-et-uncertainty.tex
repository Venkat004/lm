(a) When an excited state in a nucleus undergoes gamma decay, the half-life depends
on a variety of factors, but a fairly typical value would be about 1 ns.
Find the uncertainty in energy imposed by the energy-time uncertainty relation,
and compare with a typical excitation energy of 1 MeV.\\
(b) Some very neutron-rich nuclei are unstable with respect to emission of
a neutron, and in these cases the half-life is typically on the order of
$10^{-21}\ \sunit$. Carry out an estimate as in part a.
