In a helium nucleus, each particle feels a potential due to the attractive
forces from the other three. This potential can be well approximated as
\begin{equation*}
  U = \frac{1}{2}kr^2,
\end{equation*}
where $k$ is a constant and $r$ is the distance from the center of mass in three dimensions.
Show that the Schr\"odinger equation is separable in terms of $x$, $y$, and $z$ in this example, and
find the ground-state wavefunction and its energy. You will need the result of problem
\ref{hw:quantumho}, p.~\pageref{hw:quantumho}. Refer also to sec.~\ref{subsec:qm-corrections},
