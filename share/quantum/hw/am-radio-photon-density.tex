(a) A radio transmitter radiates power $P$ in all directions, so that the energy spreads out spherically.
Find the energy density at a distance $r$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Let the wavelength be $\lambda$.
As described in example \ref{eg:am-radio-photon-density} on p.~\pageref{eg:am-radio-photon-density},
find the number of photons in a volume $\lambda^3$ at this distance $r$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) For a 1000 kHz AM radio transmitting station, assuming reasonable values of $P$ and $r$,
verify, as claimed in the example,
that the result from part b is very large.
