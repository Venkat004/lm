Suppose we multiply a wavefunction $\Psi$ by a constant $c$.
This operation, $\mathcal{O}\Psi=c\Psi$, is linear,
which suggests that it could also be
considered an observable, abeit a trivial one that provides no 
information. To see if this is true, we also need to check that
it is Hermitian, using one of our two equivalent definitions.
(a) Does it have real eigenvalues? (b) Equivalently, is it true that
$\langle \mathcal{O} u|v\rangle = \langle  u|\mathcal{O} v\rangle$?
