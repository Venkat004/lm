% The macro eqnimage is defined in SN ch14.
Consider the wavefunctions $\Psi_1=\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}$ and $\Psi_2=\eqnimage{eqn-wave2-flipped}$ for a particle in
a one-dimensional box. Suppose we have the superposition
$\Psi=A(2\Psi_1+\Psi_2)$.\\
(a) If $\Psi$ is to be properly normalized, what is $|A|$?\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Sketch the wavefunction.\hwendpart
(c) Suppose you can measure the position of the particle very accurately.  What is the probability
that the particle will be found in the left half of the box?\answercheck\hwendpart
(d) Instead of measuring position, suppose you measure the energy of the state. What is the probability
that you'll measure the ground state energy?\answercheck\hwendpart
(e) Suppose that the wavefunction had been $\Phi=A(2\Psi_1-\Psi_2)$. Which of your
answers to parts a-d would remain the same, and which would change? (You need not redo the work
for the ones that would change. Just give your reasoning as to whether they would or would not.)
