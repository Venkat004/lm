In example \ref{eg:moat-orthogonal-traveling-waves} on p.~\pageref{eg:moat-orthogonal-traveling-waves},
we defined unnormalized wavefunctions for the traveling-wave solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation
in a ``quantum moat,'' and calculated the inner product
$\langle \text{ccw} | \text{cw} \rangle=0$ to verify that the counterclockwise and clockwise
traveling waves were orthogonal, as must be the case for distinguishable states.
Suppose we want to define a normalized version of the counterclockwise wave,
$|\text{ccw}\rangle=Ae^{i\theta}$. Use an inner product to determine $|A|^2$, and show that
normalization doesn't depend on the phase of $A$. (Do not assume that $A$ is real.)
