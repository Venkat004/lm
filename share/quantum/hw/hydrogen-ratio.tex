Hydrogen is the only element whose energy levels can be expressed exactly in an equation.
Calculate the ratio $\lambda_E/\lambda_F$ of the wavelengths of the transitions labeled
E and F in problem \ref{hw:hydrogenlevels} on p.~\pageref{hw:hydrogenlevels}. Express
your answer as an exact fraction, not a decimal approximation. In an experiment in which
atomic wavelengths are being measured, this ratio provides a natural, stringent check on
the precision of the results.\answercheck
