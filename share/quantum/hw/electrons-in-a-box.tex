Suppose we have a three-dimensional box of dimensions $2L\ \times\ 2L\ \times\ 2L$.
the box be oriented so that the shorter dimension is along the $z$ direction.\\
(a) What are the five lowest energies allowed in this box? Give the quantum numbers for each energy,
and find the degeneracy of each.\hwendpart
(b) Suppose we put five electrons in this box such that they have the lowest
possible total energ. (Keep in
mind that there is a limit to how many electrons can have the same spatial wavefunction.) What is the
total energy of this state?\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) What are the two lowest-energy photons that can excite one of the five electrons (from the situation
described in part b) to an excited state?\answercheck\hwendpart
