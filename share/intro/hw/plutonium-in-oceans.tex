Plutonium-239 is one of a small number of important long-lived forms of high-level
radioactive nuclear waste. The world's waste stockpiles have about $10^3$ metric tons
of plutonium. Drinking water is considered safe by U.S. government standards if it
contains less than $2\times10^{-13}\ \zu{g}/\zu{cm}^3$ of plutonium.
The amount of radioactivity to which you were exposed by drinking such water
on a daily basis would be very small compared to  the natural background radiation that you are
exposed to every year. Suppose that the world's inventory of plutonium-239 were ground
up into an extremely fine dust and then dispersed over the world's oceans, thereby
becoming mixed uniformly into the world's water supplies over time.
Estimate the resulting concentration of plutonium, and compare with the government standard.
