At the grocery store you will see oranges packed neatly in stacks.
Suppose we want to pack spheres as densely as possible, so that the greatest
possible fraction of the space is filled by the spheres themselves, not
by empty space. Let's call this fraction $f$.
Mathematicians have proved that the best possible result is $f\approx 0.7405$,
which requires a systematic pattern of stacking. If you buy ball bearings or golf
balls, however, the seller is probably not going to go to the trouble of stacking
them neatly. Instead they will probably pour the balls into a box and vibrate the
box vigorously for a while to make them settle. This results in a random packing.
The closest random packing has $f\approx 0.64$.
Suppose that golf balls, with a standard diameter of 4.27 cm, are sold in bulk
with the closest random packing. What is the diameter of the largest ball that
could be sold in boxes of the same size, packed systematically, so that there
would be the same number of balls per box?\answercheck
