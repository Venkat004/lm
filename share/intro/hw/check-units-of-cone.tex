Jae starts from the formula $V=\frac{1}{3}Ah$ for the volume of a
cone, where $A$ is the area of its base, and $h$ is its height.
He wants to find an equation that will tell him how tall a conical
tent has to be in order to have a certain volume, given its radius.
His algebra goes like this:
\begin{align*}
  V &= \frac{1}{3}Ah \\
  A &= \pi r^2 \\
  V &= \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h\\
  h &= \frac{\pi r^2}{3V}
\end{align*}
Use units to check whether the final result makes sense. If it doesn't,
use units to locate the line of algebra where the mistake happened.
