Let the function $x$ be defined by $x(t)=Ae^{bt}$, where $t$ has units of seconds and
$x$ has units of meters. (For $b<0$, this could be a fairly accurate model of the motion of a
bullet shot into a tank of oil.) Show that the Taylor series of this function makes sense
if and only if $A$ and $b$ have certain units.
