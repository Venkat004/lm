The distance to the horizon is given by the expression $\sqrt{2rh}$, where $r$ is the
radius of the Earth, and $h$ is the observer's height above the Earth's surface. (This can
be proved using the Pythagorean theorem.) Show that the units of this expression make
sense. (See example \ref{eg:checking-units} on p.
\pageref{eg:checking-units} for an example of how to do this.)
Don't try to prove the result, just check its units.
