(a) The graph shows the height of a water wave pulse as a
function of position.  Draw a graph of height as a function
of time for a specific point on the water.  Assume the pulse
is traveling to the right.\hwendpart
(b) Repeat part a, but assume the pulse is traveling to the
left.\hwendpart
(c) Now assume the original graph was of height as a
function of time, and draw a graph of height as a function
of position, assuming the pulse is traveling to the right.\hwendpart
(d) Repeat part c, but assume the pulse is traveling to the
left.\hwendpart
