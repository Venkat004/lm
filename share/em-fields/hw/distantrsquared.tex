        (a) As suggested in example \ref{eg:chargedrod} on page \pageref{eg:chargedrod},
        use approximations to show that the expression given for the
        electric field approaches $kQ/d^2$ for large $d$.\hwendpart
        (b) Do the same for the result of example \ref{eg:diskofcharge}
        on page \pageref{eg:diskofcharge}.
