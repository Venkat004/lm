Assume the earth is an infinite flat sheet, as some persons claim.
Flat-earth cosmologies often omit any description of what's on the
flip side, so let's assume that the gravitational field is zero
there. If the density of the earth is $4\ \zu{g}/\zu{cm}^3$,
find the thickness that the earth must have in order to give
$g=9.8\ \munit/\sunit^2$ on our side.
