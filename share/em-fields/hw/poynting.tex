        (a) Prove that in an electromagnetic plane wave, half the energy
        is in the electric field and half in the magnetic field.\hwendpart
        (b) Based on your result from part a, find the proportionality
        constant in the relation $\der\vc{p}\propto\vc{E}\times\vc{B}\der v$,
        where $\der \vc{p}$ is the momentum of the part of a plane light wave contained in the
        volume $\der v$. The vector $\vc{E}\times\vc{B}$ is known as the 
        Poynting vector. (To do this problem, you need to know the relativistic relationship between
        the energy and momentum of a beam of light.)\index{Poynting vector}\answercheck
