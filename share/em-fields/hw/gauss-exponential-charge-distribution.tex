An electron in an atom acts like a probability cloud surrounding the
nucleus. For a hydrogen atom in its lowest-energy state, the probability
falls off exponentially, so we can mock this up with a
charge density $\rho=\rho_0 e^{-r/a}$, where $r$ is the distance
from the nucleus, and $\rho_0$ and $a$ are constants.
Find the electric field.
