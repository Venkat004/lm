A dipole consists of two point charges lying on the $x$ axis,                                                     
a charge $-q$ at the origin, and a $+q$ at $x=\ell$.  The dipole is                                               
immersed in an externally imposed, nonuniform electric field with $E_x=bx$, where
$b$ is a constant. Add the forces acting on the dipole. Verify that
the total force depends only on the dipole moment, not on $q$ or $\ell$ individually,
and that the result is the same as the one found by a fancier method in example
