Example \ref{eg:line-charge-radial-dependence} on p.~\pageref{eg:line-charge-radial-dependence} showed
that the electric field of a long, uniform line of charge falls off with distance as $1/r$. By a similar
technique, show that the electric field of a uniformly charged plane has \emph{no} dependence on the
distance from the plane.
