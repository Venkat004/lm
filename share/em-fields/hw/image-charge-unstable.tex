A charged particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$ is
below a horizontal conducting plane. We wish to find the distance
$\ell$ between the particle and the plane so that the particle
will be in equilibrium, with its weight supported by electrostatic forces.\\
(a) Determine as much as possible about the form of the answer based
on units.\hwendpart
(b) Find the full result for $\ell$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) Show that the equilibrium is unstable.
