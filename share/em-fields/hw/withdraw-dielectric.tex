Suppose a parallel-plate capacitor is built so that a slab of
dielectric material can be slid in or out. (This is similar to the way a
stud finder works.) We insert the
dielectric, hook the capacitor up to a battery to charge it, and then
use an ammeter and a voltmeter to observe what happens when the
dielectric is withdrawn. Predict the changes observed on the meters,
and correlate them with the expected change in capacitance. Discuss
the energy transformations involved, and determine whether positive or
negative work is done in removing the dielectric.
