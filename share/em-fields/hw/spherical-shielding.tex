  (a) Figure \figref{eg-magnetic-shielding-sphere} on page \pageref{fig:eg-magnetic-shielding-sphere} shows a hollow sphere with $\mu/\mu_\zu{o}=x$,
  inner radius $a$, and outer radius $b$, which has been subjected to an external field $\vc{B}_\zu{o}$. Finding the fields on the exterior, in the
  shell, and on the interior requires finding a set of fields that satisfies five boundary conditions: (1) far from the sphere, the field
  must approach the constant $\vc{B}_\zu{o}$; (2) at the outer surface of the sphere, the field must have
  $\vc{H}_{\parallel,1}=\vc{H}_{\parallel,2}$, as discussed on page  \pageref{fig:permeability-boundary}; (3) the same constraint applies
  at the inner surface of the sphere; (4) and (5) there is an additional constraint on the fields at the inner and outer surfaces, as found in problem
  \ref{hw:boundary-eb}. The goal of this problem is to find the solution for the fields, and from it, to prove that the interior field
  is uniform, and given by
  \begin{equation*}
       \vc{B} = \left[\frac{9x}{(2x+1)(x+2)-2\frac{a^3}{b^3}(x-1)^2}\right]\vc{B}_\zu{o}\eqquad.
  \end{equation*}
  This is a very difficult problem to solve from first principles, because it's not obvious what form the fields should have, and if you hadn't been
  told, you probably wouldn't have guessed that the interior field would be uniform. We could, however, guess that once the sphere becomes polarized
  by the external field, it would become a dipole, and at $r\gg b$, the field would be a uniform field superimposed on the field of a dipole.
  It turns out that even close to the sphere, the solution has exactly this form. In order to complete the solution, we need to find the field
  in the shell ($a<r<b$), but the only way this field could match up with the detailed angular variation of the interior and exterior fields
  would be if it was also a superposition of a uniform field with a dipole field. The final result is that we have four unknowns: the strength
  of the dipole component of the external field, the strength of the uniform and dipole components of the field within the shell, and the
  strength of the uniform interior field. These four unknowns are to be determined by imposing constraints (2) through (5) above.\hwendpart
  (b) Show that the expression from part a has physically reasonable behavior in its dependence on $x$ and $a/b$.
