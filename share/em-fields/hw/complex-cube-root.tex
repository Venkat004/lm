Compute
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{1+i}{(-2+2i)^{1/3}}.
\end{equation*}
As often happens with fractional exponents, there is more
than one possible value. (Cf.~$4^{1/2}$, which can be $2$ or $-2$.)
Of these, find the one that lies closest to the real line. (This is
also the easiest one to find by using the techniques introduced
in the text.)\answercheck
% This is designed to be difficult to do using cartesian representation, easy using arg and mag.
