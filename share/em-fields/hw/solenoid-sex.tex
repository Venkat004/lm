        Consider two solenoids, one of which is smaller so that
        it can be put inside the other. Assume they are long enough
        to act like ideal solenoids, so that each one only
        contributes significantly to the field inside itself, and
        the interior fields are nearly uniform. Consider the
        configuration where the small one is partly inside and
        partly hanging out of the big one, with their currents
        circulating in the same direction. Their axes are constrained to coincide.\hwendpart
        (a) Find the difference in the magnetic  energy between the configuration where the
        solenoids are separate and the configuration where the small one is inserted into the
        big one. Your equation will include the
        length $x$ of the part of the small solenoid that is inside
        the big one, as well as other relevant
        variables describing the two solenoids.\answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) Based on your answer to part a, find the force acting
