        Consider two solenoids, one of which is smaller so that
        it can be put inside the other. Assume they are long enough
        so that each one only contributes significantly to the field
        inside itself, and the interior fields are nearly uniform.
        Consider the configuration where the small one is inside the
        big one with their currents circulating in the same
        direction, and a second configuration in which the currents
        circulate in opposite directions. Compare the energies of
        these configurations with the energy when the solenoids are
        far apart. Based on this reasoning, which configuration is
        stable, and in which configuration will the little solenoid
        tend to get twisted around or spit out?
