(a) Recall that the gravitational energy of two gravitationally
interacting spheres is given by $m4_ifelse(__pe,U,U,PE)_g=-Gm_1m_2/r$, where $r$ is the
center-to-center distance. What would be the analogous
equation for two electrically interacting spheres? Justify
your choice of a plus or minus sign on physical grounds,   
considering attraction and repulsion.\answercheck \hwendpart
(b) Use this
expression to estimate the energy required to pull apart a  
raisin-cookie atom of the one-electron type, assuming a
radius of $10^{-10}$ m.\answercheck \hwendpart
(c) Compare this with the result of
problem \ref{hw:foodtoatoms}.
