As shown in the figure, a particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$ hangs from a string of length $\ell$, forming
a pendulum fixed at a central point. Another charge $q$ is fixed at the same distance $\ell$,
directly below the center. Find the equilibrium values of $\theta$ and determine whether they
are stable or unstable.
