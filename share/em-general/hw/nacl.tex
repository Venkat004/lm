The figure shows one layer of the three-dimensional
structure of a salt crystal. The atoms extend much farther
off in all directions, but only a six-by-six square is shown
here. The larger circles are the chlorine ions, which have
charges of $-e$, where $e=1.60\times10^{-19}\ \zu{C}$. The smaller circles are sodium ions, with
charges of $+e$. The center-to-center distance between
neighboring ions is about 0.3 nm. Real crystals are never
perfect, and the crystal shown here has two defects: a
missing atom at one location, and an extra lithium atom,
shown as a grey circle, inserted in one of the small gaps.
If the lithium atom has a charge of $+e$, what is the
direction and magnitude of the total force on it? Assume
there are no other defects nearby in the crystal besides the
two shown here.<% hw_hint("nacl") %>\answercheck
