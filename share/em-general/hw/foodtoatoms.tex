Use the nutritional information on some packaged food to
make an order-of-magnitude estimate of the amount of
chemical energy stored in one atom of food, in units of
joules. Assume that a typical atom has a mass of $10^{-26}$
kg. This constitutes a rough estimate of the amounts of
energy there are on the atomic scale. [See 
chapter m4_ifelse(__lm_series,1,[:\ref{ch:scaling}:],[:\ref{ch:intro}:])
for help on how to do order-of-magnitude
estimates. Note that a nutritional ``calorie'' is really a
kilocalorie%
