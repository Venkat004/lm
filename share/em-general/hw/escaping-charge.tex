Several pointlike, interacting particles are released, all initially at rest, within the same
finite region of space. We want to know whether, without violating conservation
of energy, it is possible for one of these particles to be ejected to an infinite
distance, while the others stay within the original region. Consider this question
for each of the following systems.
(a) Two particles of mass $m$, interacting gravitationally. (b) Three such
particles. (c) Two particles, both with charge $q$. (d) Charges $q$ and $-q$.
(e) Charges $q$, $q$, and $-q$.
