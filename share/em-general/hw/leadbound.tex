        Suppose that a proton in a lead nucleus wanders out to
        the surface of the nucleus, and experiences a strong nuclear
        force of about 8 kN from the nearby neutrons and protons
        pulling it back in.  Compare this numerically to the
        repulsive electrical force from the other protons, and
        verify that the net force is attractive.  A lead nucleus is
        very nearly spherical, 
        is about 6.5 fm in radius, and
        contains 82 protons, each with a charge of $+e$, where
        $e=1.60\times10^{-19}\ \zu{C}$.
