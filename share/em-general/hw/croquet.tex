In the semifinals of an electrostatic croquet
tournament, Jessica hits her positively charged ball,
sending it across the playing field, rolling to the left
along the $x$ axis. It is repelled by two other positive
charges. These two equal charges are fixed on the $y$ axis
at the locations shown in the figure. (a) Express the force
on the ball in terms of the ball's position, $x$. (b) At
what value of $x$ does the ball experience the greatest
deceleration? Express you answer in terms of $b$. [Based on
a problem by Halliday and Resnick.]\answercheck
