In an experiment to measure the unknown index of refraction $n$ of a liquid, you send
a laser beam from air into a tank filled with the liquid. 
Let $\phi$ be the angle of the beam relative to the normal while in the
air, and let $\theta$ be the angle in the liquid. You can set $\phi$ to any value you
like by aiming the laser from an appropriate direction, and you measure $\theta$ as
a result. We wish to plan such an experiment so as to minimize
the error $\der n$ in the result of the experiment, for a fixed error $\der \theta$
in the measurement of the angle in the liquid. We assume that there is no significant
contribution to the error from uncertainty in the index of refraction of air (which is
very close to 1) or from the angle $\phi$. Find $\der n$ in terms of $\der\theta$, and
determine the optimal conditions.
