Estimate the radii of curvature of the two optical surfaces in the eye of the jumping spider in
in figure \figref{jumping-spider} on p.~\pageref{fig:jumping-spider}.
Use physical reasoning to modify the lensmaker's equation for a case like this one, in which there
are three indices of refraction $n_1$ (air), $n_2$ (lens), and $n_3$ (the material behind the lens),
and $n_1 \ne n_3$. Show that the interface between $n_2$ and $n_3$ contributes negligibly to
focusing, and verify that the image is produced at approximately the right place in the eye
when the object is far away. As a check on your result, direct optical measurements by M.F.~Land
in 1969 gave $f=512\ \mu\munit$.\answercheck
