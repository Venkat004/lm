Under ordinary conditions, gases have indices of refraction only
a little greater than that of vacuum, i.e., $n=1+\epsilon$, where
$\epsilon$ is some small number. 
Suppose that a ray crosses a boundary between a region of vacuum
and a region in which the index of refraction is $1+\epsilon$.
Find the maximum angle by which such a ray can ever be deflected,
in the limit of small $\epsilon$.
