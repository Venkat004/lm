The figure gives four pairs of four-vectors, oriented in our customary way as
shown by the light-cone on the left.

1. Of the types shown in the four cases i-iv, which types of vectors could represent the
world-line of an observer?

2. Suppose that $\vc{U}$ and $\vc{V}$ are both observer-vectors. What would it mean
physically to compute $\vc{U}+\vc{V}$?

3. Determine the sign of each inner product $\vc{A}\cdot\vc{B}$.

4. Given an observer whose world-line is along a four-vector $\vc{O}$,
suppose we want to determine whether some other four-vector $\vc{P}$
is also a possible world-line of an observer. Show that knowledge of
the signs of the inner products $\vc{O}\cdot\vc{P}$ and
$\vc{P}\cdot\vc{P}$  is necessary and sufficient to determine this.
Hint: Consider various possibilities like i-iv for vector $\vc{P}$,
and see how the signs would turn out.

5. For vectors as described in 4, determine the signs of
\begin{equation*}
  (\vc{U}+\vc{V})\cdot(\vc{U}+\vc{V})
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
  (\vc{U}+\vc{V})\cdot\vc{U}
\end{equation*}
by multiplying them out. Interpret the result physically.
