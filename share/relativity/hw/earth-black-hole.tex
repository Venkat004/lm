Section \ref{sec:black-holes} presented a Newtonian estimate of how compact an object would have to be
in order to be a black hole. Although this estimate is not really right, it turns out to give the right
answer to within about a factor of 2. To roughly what size would the earth have to be compressed in order to become
a black hole?
