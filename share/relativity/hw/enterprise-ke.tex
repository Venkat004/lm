In example \ref{eg:cern-muons} on page \pageref{eg:cern-muons}, I remarked that accelerating a macroscopic
(i.e., not microscopic) object to close to the speed of light would require an unreasonable amount of energy.
Suppose that the starship Enterprise from Star Trek has a mass
of $8.0\times10^7$ kg, about the same as the Queen Elizabeth 2.
Compute the kinetic energy it would have to have if it
was moving at half the speed of light. Compare with the total
energy content of the world's nuclear arsenals, which is about $10^{21}$ J.\answercheck
