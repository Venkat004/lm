The products of a certain radioactive decay are a massive particle and a gamma ray, which is massless.
See example \ref{eg:light-p-from-four-vector} on p.~\pageref{eg:light-p-from-four-vector}
for a discussion of the energy and momentum of a gamma ray.
(a) Show that, in the center of mass frame, the energy of the gamma is
less than the mass-energy of the massive particle.\hwendpart
(b) Show that the opposite inequality holds if we compare the \emph{kinetic} energy
of the massive particle to the energy of the gamma.
