Natural relativistic units were introduced on p.~\pageref{natural-units},
and examples \ref{eg:natural-to-si-1} and \ref{eg:natural-to-si-2}
on pp.~\pageref{eg:natural-to-si-1} and \pageref{eg:natural-to-si-2} gave
examples of how to convert an equation from natural units to SI units.
In example \ref{eg:gamma-for-low-v} on p.~\pageref{eg:gamma-for-low-v},
we derived the approximation
\begin{equation*}
  \mygamma\approx1+\frac{v^2}{2}
\end{equation*}
for values of $v$ that are small compared to 1 (i.e., small compared to the speed of light
in natural units). As in the other examples, convert this equation to
SI units.
