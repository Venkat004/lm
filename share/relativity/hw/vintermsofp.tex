(a) Find a relativistic equation for the velocity of an
object in terms of its mass and momentum (eliminating
$\mygamma$). Use natural units (i.e., discard factors of $c$) throughout.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Show that your result
is approximately the same as the nonrelativistic value, $p/m$, at
low velocities.\hwendpart
(c) Show that very large momenta result in
speeds close to the speed of light.\hwendpart
(d) Insert factors of $c$ to make your result from part a usable in SI units.\answercheck\hwendpart
