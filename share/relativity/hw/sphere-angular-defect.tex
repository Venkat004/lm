The angular defect $d$ of a triangle (measured in radians) is defined as $s-\pi$, where $s$ is the sum of the interior angles.
The angular defect is proportional to the area $A$ of the triangle.
Consider the geometry measured by a two-dimensional being who lives on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$.
First find some triangle on the sphere whose area and angular defect are easy to calculate. Then determine the
general equation for $d$ in terms of $A$ and $R$.\answercheck
