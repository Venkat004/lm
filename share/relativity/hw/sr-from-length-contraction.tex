Page \pageref{spacetime-properties} lists five observed properties of
space and time that sufficed to derive relativity. There are other
sets of postulates that could also have been used, and in fact this
was not the set that was first used by Einstein. Suppose that our
first inkling that spacetime isn't Galilean consists of an experiment
like the one in figure \figref{magdeflects} on p.~\pageref{fig:magdeflects},
and that we interpret it, correctly, as being evidence of a relativistic
length contraction as in figure \figref{magrelativity} on
p.~\pageref{fig:magrelativity}. Besides this
fact, what else is needed in order to get the full structure of
relativity?
