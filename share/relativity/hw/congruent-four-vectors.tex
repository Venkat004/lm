The figure shows seven four-vectors, represented in a two-dimensional
plot of $x$ versus $t$. All the vectors have $y$ and $z$ components
that are zero. Which of these vectors are congruent to others, i.e.,
which represent spacetime intervals that are equal to one another?
If you reason based on Euclidean geometry, you will get the wrong answers.
