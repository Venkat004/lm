We want to throw a ball of diameter $b$ through a hole of diameter $h$ in a thin wall.
Clearly this is possible if $b<h$, but consider the case where $b>h$.
If the motion is relativistic, then is it unambiguous whether the ball fits through the hole,
or is this frame-dependent, as in example \ref{eg:garage-paradox} on p.~\pageref{eg:garage-paradox}?
If the former, then is there some velocity $v$ that is required, expressible in terms of
$b$ and $h$?
