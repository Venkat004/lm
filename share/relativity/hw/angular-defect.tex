Prove, as claimed in the caption of figure \figref{angular-defect-propto-area}
on p.~\pageref{fig:angular-defect-propto-area},
that $S-180\degunit=4(s-180\degunit)$, where $S$ is the
sum of the angles of the large equilateral triangle and $s$
is the corresponding sum for one of the four small ones.<% hw_solution %>
