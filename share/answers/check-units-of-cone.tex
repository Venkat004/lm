The final line is supposed to be an equation for the height, so the units of the
expression on the right-hand side had better equal meters. 
The pi and the 3 are unitless, so we can ignore them.   
In terms of units, the final becomes
\begin{equation*}
  \munit = \frac{\munit^2}{\munit^3} = \frac{1}{\munit}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
This is false, so there must be a mistake in the algebra. The units
of lines 1, 2, and 3 check out, so the mistake must be in the step
from line 3 to line 4. In fact the result should have been 
\begin{equation*}
  h = \frac{3V}{\pi r^2}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Now the units check: $\munit = \munit^3/\munit^2$.
