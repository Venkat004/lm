(a) Spring constants in parallel add, so the spring constant has to be proportional
 to the cross-sectional area. Two springs in series give half the spring constant, 
three springs in series give 1/3, and so on, so the spring constant has to be 
inversely proportional to the length. Summarizing, we have $k\propto A/L$.\\
 (b) With the
 Young's modulus, we have $k=(A/L)E$.The spring constant has units of N/m, so
 the units of E would have to be $\nunit/\munit^2$.
