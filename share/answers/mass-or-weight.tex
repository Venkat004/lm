(a) This is a measure of the box's resistance to a change in its state of
motion, so it measures the box's mass. The experiment would come out the same
in lunar gravity.\\
(b) This is a measure of how much gravitational force it feels, so it's a measure
of weight. In lunar gravity, the box would make a softer sound when it hit.\\
(c) As in part a, this is a measure of its resistance to a change in its state
of motion: its mass. Gravity isn't involved at all.
