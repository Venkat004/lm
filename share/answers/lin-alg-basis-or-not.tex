$\{\hat{\vc{x}}\}$ is not a basis, because there are vectors such as $\hat{\vc{y}}$ that we can't form
as a linear combination (i.e., scalar multiple) of $\hat{\vc{x}}$.
%
$\{\hat{\vc{x}},\hat{\vc{y}}\}$ is the standard basis for this vector space.
%
$\{\hat{\vc{-x}},\hat{\vc{x}}+\hat{\vc{y}}\}$ also works as a basis, because the two
vectors are linearly independent, and it's easy to check that any vector in the plane
can be formed as a linear superposition of them.
%
$\{\hat{\vc{x}},\hat{\vc{y}},\hat{\vc{x}}+\hat{\vc{y}}\}$ is not a basis, because
these three vectors are not linearly independent.
