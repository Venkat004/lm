(a) The energy stored in the gasoline is being changed
into heat via frictional heating, and also probably into
sound and into energy of water waves. Note that the kinetic
energy of the propeller and the boat are not changing, so
they are not involved in the energy transformation. (b) The
crusing speed would be greater by a factor of the cube root
of 2, or about a 26\% increase.
