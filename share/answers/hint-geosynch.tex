The condition for a circular orbit
contains three unknowns, $v$, $g$, and $r$, so you can't just solve it for $r$. You'll need
more equations to make three equations in three unknowns. You'll need a relationship
between $g$ and $r$, and also a relationship between $v$ and $r$ that uses the
given fact that it's supposed to take 24 hours for an orbit.
