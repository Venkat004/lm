Let's get all the electrical units in terms of Teslas. Electric field
units can be expressed as $\zu{T}\cdot\zu{m}/\zu{s}$. The circulation
of the electric field has units of electric field multiplied by
distance, or $\zu{T}\cdot\zu{m}^2/\zu{s}$. On the right side, the
derivative $\partial\zb{B}/\partial t$ has units of $\zu{T}/\zu{s}$,
and multiplying this my area gives units of
$\zu{T}\cdot\zu{m}^2/\zu{s}$, just like on the left side.
