(a) The object distance is less than the focal length, so the
image is virtual: because the object is so close, the cone of rays
is diverging too strongly for the mirror to bring it back to a focus.
(b) Now the object distance is greater than the focal length, so the image
is real.
(c),(d) A diverging mirror can only make virtual images.
