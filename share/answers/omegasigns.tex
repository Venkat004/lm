Reversing the direction of $\omega$ also reverses the direction of 
motion, and this is reflected by the relationship between the plus and minus signs.
 In the equation for the radial acceleration, $\omega$ is squared, so even if $\omega$
 is negative, the
 result is positive. This makes sense because the acceleration is always inward in
 circular motion, never outward.
