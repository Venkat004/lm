(a) Based on units, we must have $g=kG\lambda/y$, where $k$ is a unitless universal constant.\\
(b) For the actual calculation, we have
\begin{align*}
  g &= \int \der g_y \\
    &= G\int \frac{\der m}{r^2} \cos\theta,
\end{align*}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the perpendicular and the $\vc{r}$ vector.
Then $\der m=\lambda \der x$, $\cos\theta=y/r$, and $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, so
\begin{align*}
  g &= G\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda \der x}{x^2+y^2} \cdot \frac{b}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \\
    &= G\lambda y \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x^2+y^2)^{-3/2}\der x.
\end{align*}
Even though this has limits of integration, this is an indefinite integral because it contains the variable $y$.
It's nicer to clean this up by doing a change of variable to the unitless quantity $u=x/y$, giving
\begin{equation*}
  g = \frac{G\lambda}{y} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (u^2+1)^{-3/2}\der u.
\end{equation*}
The definite integral is the sort of thing that sane people these days will do using
computer software. It equals 2. The result for the field is
\begin{equation*}
   g = \frac{2G\lambda}{y}.
\end{equation*}
