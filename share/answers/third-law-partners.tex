(a) The swimmer's acceleration is caused by the water's
force on the swimmer, and the swimmer makes a backward force
on the water, which accelerates the water backward. (b) The
club's normal force on the ball accelerates the ball, and
the ball makes a backward normal force on the club, which
decelerates the club. (c) The bowstring's normal force
accelerates the arrow, and the arrow also makes a backward
normal force on the string. This force on the string causes
the string to accelerate less rapidly than it would if the
bow's force was the only one acting on it. (d) The tracks'
backward frictional force slows the locomotive down. The
locomotive's forward frictional force causes the whole
planet earth to accelerate by a tiny amount, which is too
small to measure because the earth's mass is so great.
