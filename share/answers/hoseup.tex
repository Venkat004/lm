The stream has to spread out. When the velocity becomes zero, it
seems like the cross-sectional area has to become infinite. In
reality, this is the point where the water turns around and comes
back down. The infinity isn't real; it occurs mathematically because
we used a simplified model of the the stream of water, assuming, for
instance, that the water's velocity is always straight up.
