Velocity is relative, so having to lean tells you nothing
about the current value of the train's velocity.  Fullerton is moving at a huge
speed relative to Beijing, but that doesn't produce any
noticeable effect in either city.  The fact that you have to
lean tells you that the train is \emph{changing} its speed,
but it doesn't tell you what the train's current speed is.
