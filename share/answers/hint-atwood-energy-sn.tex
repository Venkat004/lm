You can use either
the chain-rule technique from page  \pageref{gaccelproof} or the technique prescribed
in problem \ref{hw:gaccelproof2} on p. \pageref{hw:gaccelproof2}. The
positions and velocities of the two masses are related to each other, and you'll need
to use this relationship to eliminate one mass's position and velocity and get everything
in terms of the other mass's position and velocity. The relationship between the
two positions will involve some extraneous variables like the length of the string,
which won't have any effect on your final result.
