Yes. For example, the force vanishes if the particle's
velocity is parallel to the field, so if the beam had been
launched parallel to the field, it would have gone in a
straight line rather than a circle. In general, any
component of the velocity vector that is out of the plane
perpendicular to the field will remain constant, so the
motion can be helical.
