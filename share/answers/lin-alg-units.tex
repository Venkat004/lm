To do anything useful with these expressions describing units, we need to
be able to talk about things like dividing meters by seconds to get meters
per second. Thus ``addition'' needs to be multiplication, which corresponds to
adding the exponents.  Scalar ``multiplication'' actually has to be exponentiation,
e.g., ``multiplying'' units of meters by the scalar 2 should give square meters.
