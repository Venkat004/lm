Let $m$ be the mass of the little puck and $M=2.3m$ be
the mass of the big one. All we need to do is find the
direction of the total momentum vector before the collision,
because the total momentum vector is the same after the
collision. Given the two components of the momentum vector
$p_x=Mv$ and $p_y=mv$, the direction of the
vector is $\tan^{-1}(p_y/p_x)=23\degunit$ counterclockwise from
the big puck's original direction of motion.
