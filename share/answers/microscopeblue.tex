You don't want the wave properties of light to cause all
kinds of funny-looking diffraction effects. You want to see
the thing you're looking at in the same way you'd see a big
object.  Diffraction effects are most pronounced when the
wavelength of the light is relatively large compared to the size of the
object the light is interacting with, so red would be the worst.
Blue light is near
the short-wavelength end of the visible spectrum, which would be the best.
