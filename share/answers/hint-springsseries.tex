The variables
$x_1$ and $x_2$ will adjust themselves to reach an equilibrium. Write down the total
energy in terms of $x_1$ and $x_2$, then eliminate one variable, and find the
equilibrium value of the other. Finally, eliminate both $x_1$ and $x_2$ from the
total energy, getting it just in terms of $b$.
