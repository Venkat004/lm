The partner's hands are not touching the climber, so they don't make any force
on him. The hands have an indirect effect through the rope, but our concept of
force only includes direct effects (section \ref{sec:what-force-is-not}, p.~\pageref{sec:what-force-is-not}).

The corrected table looks like this:

\begin{tabular}{p{90mm}}
force of the earth's gravity, $\downarrow$ \\
force from the rope, $\uparrow$ \\
\end{tabular}

The student is also wrong to claim that the upward and downward forces are
unbalanced. The climber is moving down at constant speed, so his
acceleration is zero, and the total force acting on him is zero.
The upward and downward forces are of equal strength, and they
cancel.
