(1) In 1, the rays cross the image, so it's real. In 2, the rays only appear to have come from the
image point, so the image is virtual.
(2) A rays is always closer to the normal in the medium with the higher index of refraction. The first
left turn makes the ray closer to the normal, which is what should happen in glass. The second left
turn makes the ray farther from the normal, and that's what should happen in air.
(3) Take the topmost ray as an example. It will still take two right turns, but since it's entering
the lens at a steeper angle, it will also leave at a steeper angle. Tracing backward to the image,
the steeper lines will meet closer to the lens.
