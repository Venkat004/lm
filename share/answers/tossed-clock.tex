By the equivalence principle, we can adopt a frame tied to the tossed clock, B, and in this
frame there is no gravitational field. We see a desk and clock A go by. The desk applies
a force to clock A, decelerating it and then reaccelerating it so that it comes back.
We've already established that the effect of motion is to slow down time, so clock
A reads a smaller time interval.
