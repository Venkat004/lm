We have $n=\sin\phi/\sin\theta$. Doing implicit differentiation,
we find $\der n=-\sin\phi (\cos\theta/\sin^2\theta)\der \theta$,
which can be rewritten as 
$\der n=-n\operatorname{cot}\theta\der\theta$. This can be minimized
by making $\theta$ as big as possible. To make $\theta$ as big as
possible, we want $\phi$ to be as close as possible to 90 degrees,
i.e., almost grazing the surface of the tank.

This result makes sense, because we're depending on refraction in
order to get a measurement of $n$. At $\phi=0$, we get $\theta=0$,
which provides no information at all about the index of
refraction --- the error bars become infinite. The amount of
refraction increases as the angles get bigger.
