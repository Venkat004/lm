Room temperature is about $20\degcunit$. 
The fraction of the energy that actually goes into heating the water is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{(250\ \gunit)/(0.24\ \gunit\unitdot\degcunit/\junit)\times(100\degcunit-20\degcunit)}{\left(1.25\times10^3\ \junit/\sunit\right)(126\ \sunit)} = 0.53
\end{equation*}
So roughly half of the energy is wasted. The wasted energy
might be in several forms: heating of the cup, heating of
the oven itself, or leakage of microwaves from the oven.
