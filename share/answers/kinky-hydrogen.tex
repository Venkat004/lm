The original argument was that a kink would have a zero wavelength, which would correspond
to an infinite momentum and an infinite kinetic energy, and that would violate conservation
of energy. But the kink in this example occurs at $r=0$, which is right on top of the
proton, where the electrical energy $-ke^2/r$ is infinite and \emph{negative}. Since
the electrical energy is negative and infinite, we're actually \emph{required} to have
an infinite positive kinetic energy in order to come up with a total that conserves
energy.
