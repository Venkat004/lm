By conservation of momentum, the total momenta of the pieces
after the explosion is the same as the momentum of the firework
before the explosion. However, there is no law of conservation
of kinetic energy, only a law of conservation of energy. The chemical
energy in the gunpowder is converted into heat and kinetic energy when
it explodes. All we can say about the kinetic energy of the pieces is
that their total is greater than the kinetic energy before the
explosion.
