Since the wavelengths of radio waves are thousands of times longer, diffraction causes the resolution
of a radio telescope to be thousands of times worse, all other things being equal. (To compensate
for the wavelength, it's desirable to make the telescope very large, as in figure
\figref{very-large-array} on page \pageref{fig:very-large-array}.)

($1\ \text{rectangle}=5\ \zu{cm}\times0.005\ \zu{cm}^{-1}=0.025$), but that would
have been pointless, because we were just going to compare the two areas.
