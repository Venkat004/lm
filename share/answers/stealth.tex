Because the surfaces are flat, you get specular reflection.
In specular reflection, all the reflected rays go in one
direction. Unless the plane is directly overhead, that direction
won't be the right direction to make the rays come back to the
radar station.

This is different from a normal plane, which has complicated,
bumpy surfaces. These surfaces give diffuse reflection, which
spreads the reflected rays randomly in more or less every 
possible direction.
