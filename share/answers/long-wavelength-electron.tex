Wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum, so to produce a large wavelength we would
need to use electrons with very small momenta and energies. (In practical terms, this isn't
very easy to do, since ripping an electron out of an object is a violent process, and it's
not so easy to calm the electron down afterward.)
