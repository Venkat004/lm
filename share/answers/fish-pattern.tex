The wave pattern will look like this: \anonymousinlinefig{three-quarter-wave}.
Three quarters of a wavelength fit in the tube, so the
wavelength is three times shorter than that of the lowest-frequency
mode, in which one quarter of a wave fits. Since the wavelength is
smaller by a factor of three, the frequency is three times higher.
Instead of $f_\zu{o}, 2f_\zu{o}, 3f_\zu{o}, 4f_\zu{o}, \ldots$, the pattern of wave frequencies of
this air column goes $f_\zu{o}, 3f_\zu{o}, 5f_\zu{o}, 7f_\zu{o}, \ldots$
