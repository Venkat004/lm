(a) No. The pack is moving at constant velocity, so its kinetic energy is staying the same. It is only moving
horizontally, so its gravitational potential energy is also staying the same. No energy transfer is occurring. (b) No. The
horse's upward force on the pack forms a 90-degree angle with the direction of motion, so 
$\cos \theta=0$, and no work is done.
