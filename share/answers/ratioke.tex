        We don't have actual masses and velocities to plug in to   
        the equation, but that's OK. We just have to reason in terms
        of ratios and proportionalities. Kinetic energy is
        proportional to mass and to the square of velocity, so B's
        kinetic energy equals $(13.4\ \zu{J})(3.77)/(2.34)^2 = 9.23\ \zu{J}$.
