(a) Conservation of energy gives
\begin{align*}
        U_A             &= U_B+K_B\\
        K_B             &= U_A-U_B\\
        \frac{1}{2}mv^2 &= e\Delta V\\
        v &= \sqrt{\frac{2e\Delta V}{m}}
\end{align*}\\
(b) Plugging in numbers, we get $5.9\times10^7$ m/s. This is about
20\% of the speed of light, so the nonrelativistic assumption
was good to at least a rough approximation.
