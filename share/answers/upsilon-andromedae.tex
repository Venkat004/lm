Newton's law of gravity depends on the inverse square of
the distance, so if the two planets' masses had been equal,
then the factor of $0.83/0.059=14$ in distance would have
caused the force on planet c to be $14^2=2.0\times10^2$
times weaker. However, planet c's mass is 3.0 times greater,
so the force on it is only smaller by a factor of $2.0\times10^2 /3.0=65$.
