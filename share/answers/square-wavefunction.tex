The expressions $|\Psi|^2$ and $|\Psi^2|$ are identical, because the
magnitude of a product is the product of the magnitudes. These expressions
give positive real numbers as their results, which makes sense for
a probability density. The expression $\Psi^2$ need not be real, and
if it is real, it may be negative. It cannot be interpreted as a probability
density. As a concrete example, suppose that $\Psi= b i$, where $b$ is a real
number with units.
Then $|\Psi|^2=|\Psi^2|=b^2$, which is real and positive, but $\Psi^2=-b^2$,
which clearly can't be interpreted probabilistically, because it's negative.
