No. To get the best possible interference, the thickness of the
coating must be such that the second reflected wave train lags behind
the first by an integer number of wavelengths. Optimal performance
can therefore only be produced for one specific color of light. The
typical greenish color of the coatings shows that it does the worst
job for green light.
