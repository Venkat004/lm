The equal-area law makes equally good sense in the case of
 a hyperbolic orbit (and observations verify it). The
elliptical orbit law had to be generalized by Newton to include
 hyperbolas. The law of periods doesn't make sense
in the case of a hyperbolic orbit, because a hyperbola never closes
 back on itself, so the motion never repeats.
