Doubling the radius of the solenoid would mean that every distance in
the problem would be doubled, which would tend to make the fields
weaker, since fields fall off with distance. However, doubling the
radius would also mean that we had twice as much wire, and therefore
twice as many moving charges to create magnetic fields. Since the
magnetic field of a wire falls off like $1/r$, it's not surprising
that the first effect amounts to exactly a factor of $1/2$, which is
exactly enough to cancel out the factor of 2 from the second effect.
