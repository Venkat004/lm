Frictionless ice can certainly make a normal force, since otherwise
 a hockey puck would sink into the ice. Friction is
not possible without a normal force, however: we can see this
 from the equation, or from common sense, e.g., while
sliding down a rope you do not get any friction unless you grip the rope.
