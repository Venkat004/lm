(a) The voltage (height) increases as you move to the east or north.
If we let the positive $x$ direction be east, and choose positive $y$ to
be north, then $\der V/\der x$ and $\der V/\der y$ are both positive. This means that $E_x$
and $E_y$ are both negative, which makes sense, since the water is
flowing in the negative $x$ and $y$ directions (south and west).\\
(b) The
electric fields are all pointing away from the higher ground. If this
was an electrical map, there would have to be a large concentration of
charge all along the top of the ridge, and especially at the mountain
peak near the south end.
