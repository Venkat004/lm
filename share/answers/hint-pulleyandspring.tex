The spring constant of this spring, $k$, is \emph{not} the quantity
you need in the equation for the period. What you need in that equation
is the second derivative of the spring's energy with respect to the
position of the thing that's oscillating. You need to 
start by finding the energy stored in the spring as a function of
the vertical position, $y$, of the mass. This is similar to
example \ref{eg:leverspring} on page \pageref{eg:leverspring}.
