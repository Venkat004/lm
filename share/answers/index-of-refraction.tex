(1) If $n_1$ and $n_2$ are equal, Snell's law becomes $\sin\theta_1=\sin\theta_2$, which implies
$\theta_1=\theta_2$, since both angles are between 0 and 90\degunit. The graph would be a straight
line along the diagonal of the graph. (2) The graph is farthest from the diagonal when the angles
are large, i.e., when the ray strikes the interface at a grazing angle.
