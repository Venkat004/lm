Torques 1, 2, and 4 all have the same sign, because they are trying
to twist the wrench clockwise. The sign of 3 is opposite to the signs
of 1, 2, and 4. The magnitude of 3 is the greatest, since it has a
large $r$ and the force is nearly all perpendicular to the wrench.
Torques 1 and 2 are the same because they have the same values of $r$
and $F_{\perp}$. Torque 4 is the smallest, due to its small $r$.
