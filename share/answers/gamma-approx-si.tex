To make the units make sense, we need to make sure that both sides of the $\approx$ sign have
the same units, and also that both terms on the right-hand side have the same units. Everything
is unitless except for the second term on the right, so we add a factor of $c^{-2}$ to fix it:
\begin{equation*}
  \mygamma\approx1+\frac{v^2}{2c^2}.
\end{equation*}
