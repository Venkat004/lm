In one second, the ship moves $v$ meters to the east,
and the person moves $v$ meters north relative to the deck.
Relative to the water, he traces the diagonal of a triangle
whose length is given by the Pythagorean theorem, 
$(v^2+v^2)^{1/2}=\sqrt{2}v$. Relative to the water, he is moving at
a 45-degree angle between north and east.
