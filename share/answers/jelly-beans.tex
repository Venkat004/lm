Directly guessing the number of jelly beans would be like guessing volume directly. That
would be a mistake. Instead, we start by estimating the linear dimensions, in units of
beans. The contents of the jar look like they're about 10 beans deep. Although the jar
is a cylinder, its exact geometrical shape doesn't really matter for the purposes of
our order-of-magnitude estimate. Let's pretend it's a rectangular jar. The horizontal
dimensions are also something like 10 beans, so it looks like the jar has about
$10\times 10 \times 10$ or $\sim 10^3$ beans inside.
