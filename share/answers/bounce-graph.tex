Since the lines are at intervals of one m/s and one
second, each box represents one meter. From $t=0$ to $t=2$ s,
the area under the curve represents a positive $\Delta x$ of
6 m. (The triangle has half the area of the $2\times6$ rectangle
it fits inside.) After $t=2$ s, the area above the curve
represents negative $\Delta x$. To get $-6$ m worth of area,
we need to go out to $t=6$ s, at which point the triangle
under the axis has a width of 4 s and a height of 3 m/s,
for an area of 6 m (half of $3\times4$).
