(a) The asteroid's mass depends on the cube of its
radius, and for a given mass the surface gravity depends on
$r^{-2}$. The result is that surface gravity is directly
proportional to radius. Half the gravity means half the
radius, or one eighth the mass. (b) To agree with a, Earth's
mass would have to be 1/8 Jupiter's. We assumed spherical
shapes and equal density. Both planets are at least roughly
spherical, so the only way out of the contradiction is if
Jupiter's density is significantly less than Earth's.
