This is similar to problem
\ref{hw:pulley}, in that you're looking for a setup that will give zero
acceleration, and the distance the middle weight rises or falls is not the same as the distance
the other two weights fall or rise. The simplest approach is to get the three heights
in terms of $\theta$, so that you can write the gravitational energy in terms of $\theta$.
