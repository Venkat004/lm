Whenever energy is transferred out of the spring, the same amount has to be transferred into the ball, and vice
versa. As the spring compresses, the ball is doing positive work on the spring (giving up its KE and transferring
energy into the spring as PE), and as it decompresses the ball is doing negative work (extracting energy).
