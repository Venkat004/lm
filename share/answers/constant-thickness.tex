One surface is curved outward and one inward. Therefore the minus sign
applies in the lensmaker's equation. Since the radii of curvature are
equal, the quantity $1/r_1-1/r_2$ equals zero, and the resulting focal
length is infinite. A big focal length indicates a weak lens. An infinite
focal length tells us that the lens is infinitely weak --- it doesn't
focus or defocus rays at all.
