(a) Looking up the relevant density for air, and converting everything to mks,
we get a frequency of 730 Hz. This is on the right order of magnitude, which
is promising, considering the crudeness of the approximation.
(b) This brings the result down to 400 Hz, which is amazingly close to the
observed frequency of 300 Hz.
