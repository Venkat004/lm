Among the spacelike vectors, $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{e}$ are clearly congruent,
because they're the same except for a rotation in space; this is the same
as the definition of congruence in ordinary Euclidean geometry, where rotation
doesn't matter. Vector $\vc{b}$ is also congruent to these, since it
represents an interval $3^2-5^2=-4^2$, just like the other two.

The lightlike vectors $\vc{c}$ and $\vc{d}$ both represent intervals of
zero, so they're congruent, even though $\vc{c}$ is a double-scale version
of $\vc{d}$.

The timelike vectors $\vc{f}$ and $\vc{g}$ are not congruent to each other
or to any of the others; $\vc{f}$ represents an interval of $2^2$, while
$\vc{g}$'s interval is $4^2$.
