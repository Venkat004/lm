(a) $\sim 2-10\%$ (b) $5\%$ (c) The high end for the body's
actual efficiency is higher than the limit imposed by the
laws of thermodynamics. However, the high end of the 1-5 watt range
quoted in the problem probably includes large people who aren't
just lying around. Still, it's impressive that the human body
comes so close to the thermodynamic limit.
