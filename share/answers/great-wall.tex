Let's estimate the Great Wall's volume, and then figure out how many
bricks that would represent.
The wall is famous because it covers pretty much all of China's
northern border, so let's say it's 1000 km long. From pictures, it
looks like it's about 10 m high and 10 m wide, so the total volume
would be $10^6\ \munit\times10\ \munit\times10\ \munit=10^8\ \munit^3$.
If a single brick has a volume of 1 liter, or $10^{-3}\ \munit^3$, then
this represents about $10^{11}$ bricks. If one person can lay 10 bricks
in an hour (taking into account all the preparation, etc.), then this
would be $10^{10}$ man-hours.
