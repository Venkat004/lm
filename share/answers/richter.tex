Since they differ by two steps on the Richter scale, the
energy of the bigger quake is $10^4$ times greater. The wave
forms a hemisphere, and the surface area of the hemisphere
over which the energy is spread is proportional to the
square of its radius, $A \propto r^2$, or $r\propto\sqrt{A}$,
which means $r_1/r_2=\sqrt{A_1/A_2}$. If the amount of vibration was the
same, then the surface areas must be in the ratio
$A_1/A_2=10^4$, which means that the ratio of the radii is $10^2$.
