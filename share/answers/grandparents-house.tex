The diagram for the house looks like \anonymousinlinefig{../../../share/relativity/figs/grandparents-house-1}
because in the one dimension of space being represented, it has walls on both sides, and
its existence also extends over a certain amount of time (left to right). If the dog is
in the house at rest, then goes outside, and stays at rest in the back yard for a while,
the spacetime diagram looks like this: 
\anonymousinlinefig{../../../share/relativity/figs/grandparents-house-2}.
An observer using another frame of reference has to agree that the dog went outside, because
observers agree on intersections of world-lines, and the dog's world-line intersects the
world-line of the house's back wall.
