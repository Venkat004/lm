The dashed lines on the graph are about twice as far apart in the
second cycle compared to the first, so the amplitude has doubled. For
sufficiently small oscillations around an equilibrium with $x=0$ and
$U(0)=0$, it's always a good approximation to take $U\propto x^2$, so
the energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude; this is a
general fact about all oscillations, provided that the amplitude is
small. Since the amplitude doubled, the energy quadrupled.
