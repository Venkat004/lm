Suppose the river is 1 m deep, 100 m wide, and flows
at a speed of 10 m/s, and that the falls are 100 m tall.
In 1 second, the volume of water flowing over the falls is
$10^3\ \munit^3$, with a mass of $10^6$  kg. The potential energy
released in one second is $(10^6\ \kgunit)(g)(100\ \munit)=10^9\ \junit$, so the
power is $10^9$ W. A typical household might have 10
hundred-watt applicances turned on at any given time, so it
consumes about $10^3$  watts on the average. The plant could
supply a about million households with electricity.
