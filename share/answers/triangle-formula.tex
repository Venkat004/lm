(a) They're all defined in terms of the ratio of side of a triangle
to another. For instance, the tangent is the length of the opposite
side over the length of the adjacent side. Dividing meters by meters
gives a unitless result, so the tangent, as well as the other trig
functions, is unitless.
(b) The tangent function gives a unitless result, so the units
on the right-hand side had better cancel out. They do,
because the top of the fraction has units of meters squared,
and so does the bottom.
