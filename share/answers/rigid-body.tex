Coasting on a bike and coasting on skates give one-dimensional
 center-of-mass motion, but running and pedaling
require moving body parts up and down, which makes
 the center of mass move up and down. The only example of
rigid-body motion is coasting on skates. (Coasting on
 a bike is not rigid-body motion, because the wheels twist.)
