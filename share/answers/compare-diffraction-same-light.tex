(a) You can tell it's a single slit because of the
double-width central fringe.\\

(b) Four fringes on the top pattern are about 23.5 mm,
while five fringes on the bottom one are about 14.5 mm.
The spacings are 5.88 and 2.90 mm, with a ratio of
2.03. A smaller $d$ leads to larger diffraction angles,
so the width of the slit used to make the bottom pattern
was almost exactly twice as wide as the one used to make the
top one.
