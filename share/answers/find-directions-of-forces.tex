(1) Normal forces are always perpendicular to the surface of contact,
 which means right or left in this figure. Normal
forces are repulsive, so the cliff's force on the feet
 is to the right, i.e., away from the cliff.  (2) Frictional forces are
always parallel to the surface of contact, which means right or left
 in this figure. Static frictional forces are in the
direction that would tend to keep the surfaces from slipping over
 each other. If the wheel was going to slip, its
surface would be moving to the left, so the static frictional force on
 the wheel must be in the direction that would
prevent this, i.e., to the right. This makes sense, because it is
 the static frictional force that accelerates the
dragster.  (3) Normal forces are always perpendicular to the surface of
 contact. In this diagram, that means either
up and to the left or down and to the right. Normal forces are 
repulsive, so the ball is pushing the bat away from
itself. Therefore the ball's force is down and to the right on this diagram.
