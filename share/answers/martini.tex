The cone of mixed gin and vermouth is the same shape as
the cone of vermouth, but its linear dimensions are doubled.
Translating the proportionality $V\propto L^3$ into an equation
about ratios, we have $V_1/V_2=(L_1/L_2)^3=8$.
Since the ratio of the whole thing to the vermouth is 8,
the ratio of gin to vermouth is 7.
