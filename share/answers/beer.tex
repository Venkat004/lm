Galilean relativity says that experiments can't come out differently
just because they're performed while in motion. The tilting of the
surface tells us the train is accelerating, but it doesn't tell us
anything about the train's velocity at that instant. The person in
the train might say the bottle's velocity was zero (but changing),
whereas a person working in a reference frame attached to the dirt
outside says it's moving; they don't agree on velocities. They
\emph{do} agree on accelerations. The person in the train has to
agree that the train is accelerating, since otherwise there's no
reason for the funny tilting effect.
