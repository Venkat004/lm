It would have to have a wavelength on the order of centimeters or meters, the same distance scale
as that of your body. These would be microwaves or radio waves. (This effect can easily be noticed
when a person affects a TV's reception by standing near the antenna.) None of this contradicts the
correspondence principle, which only states that the wave model must agree with the ray model when the
ray model is applicable. The ray model is not applicable here because $\lambda/d$ is on the order
of 1.
