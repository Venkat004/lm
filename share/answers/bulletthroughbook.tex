A force is an interaction between two objects, so while
the bullet is in the air, there is no force. There is only a
force while the bullet is in contact with the book. There is
energy the whole time, and the total amount doesn't change.
The bullet has some kinetic energy, and transfers some of it
to the book as heat, sound, and the energy required to tear
a hole through the book.
