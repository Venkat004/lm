(a) If the expression $1+by$ is to make sense, then $by$ has to be unitless, so $b$ has units of $\munit^{-1}$.
The input to the exponential function also has to be unitless, so $k$ also has of $\munit^{-1}$.
The only factor with units on the right-hand side is $P_o$, so $P_o$ must have units of pressure, or Pa.\\
(b)
\begin{align*}
  \der P &= \rho g \der y \\
  \rho &= \frac{1}{g} \frac{\der P}{\der y} \\
    &= \frac{P_o}{g} e^{-ky}(-k-kby+b)
\end{align*}
(c) The three terms inside the parentheses on the right all have units of $\munit^{-1}$, so it makes sense
to add them, and the factor in parentheses has those units. The units of the result from b then look like
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\kgunit}{\munit^3} &= \frac{\zu{Pa}}{\munit/\sunit^2}\munit^{-1} \\
                           &= \frac{\nunit/\munit^2}{\munit^2/\sunit^2} \\
                           &= \frac{\kgunit\unitdot\munit^{-1}\unitdot\sunit^{-2}}{\munit^2/\sunit^2},
\end{align*}
which checks out.
