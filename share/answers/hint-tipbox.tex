The choice of axis theorem only applies to a closed system, or to a
system acted on by a total force of zero. Even if the box is not going
to rotate, its center of mass is going to accelerate,
and this can still cause a change in its angular momentum, unless
the right axis is chosen. For example, if the axis is chosen
at the bottom right corner, then the box will start accumulating
clockwise angular momentum, even if it is just accelerating to the
right without rotating. Only by choosing the axis at the center of
mass (or at some other point on the same horizontal line) do we get
a constant, zero angular momentum.
