(a) It doesn't have $w$ or $h$ in it.
(b) Inertia is measured by $\mu$, tightness by $T$.
(c) Inertia would be measured by the density of the metal, tightness by its resistance to compression. Lead is more dense than aluminum,
and this would tend to make the speed of the waves lower in lead. Lead is also softer, so it probably has less resistance to compression,
and we would expect this to provide an additional effect in the same direction. Compressional waves will definitely be slower in lead
than in aluminum.
