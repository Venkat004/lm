(1) Not valid. The equation only applies to fluids. (2)
Valid. The density of the air is nearly constant between the
top and bottom of the building. (3) Not valid. There is a
large difference is the density of the air between the top
and the bottom of the mountain. (4) Not valid, because $g$
isn't constant throughout the interior of the earth. (5) Not
valid, because the air is flowing around the wing. The air
is accelerating, so it is not in equilibrium.
