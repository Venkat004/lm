At the top of the graph, $d_i$ approaches infinity when $d_o$ approaches $f$. Interpretation:
the rays just barely converge to the right of the mirror.

On the far right, $d_i$ approaches
$f$ as $d_o$ approaches infinity; this is the definition of the focal length.

At the bottom, $d_i$ approaches negative infinity when $d_o$ approaches $f$ from the
other side. Interpretation: the rays don't quite converge on the right side of the mirror,
so they appear to have come from a virtual image point very far to the left of the
mirror.
