(a) The patterns have two structures, a coarse one and a fine one.
You can look up in the book which corresponds to $w$ and which to $d$,
or just use the fact that smaller features make bigger diffraction
angles. The top and middle patterns have the same coarse spacing, so they
have the same $w$. The fine structure in the top pattern has
7 fringes in 12.5 mm, for a spacing of 1.79 mm, while the middle pattern
has 11 fringes in 41.5 mm, giving a spacing of 3.77 mm. The value of
$d$ for the middle pattern is therefore $(0.50\ \zu{mm})(1.79/3.77)=0.23$ mm.\\

(b) This one has about the same $d$ as the top one (it's difficult to measure
accurately because each group has only a small number of fringes),
but the coarse spacing
is different, indicating a different value of $w$. It has two coarse
groupings in 23 mm, i.e., a spacing of 12.5 mm. The coarse groupings
in the original pattern were about 23 mm apart, so there is a factor
of two between the $w=0.04$ mm of the top pattern and the $w=0.08$ mm
of the bottom one.
