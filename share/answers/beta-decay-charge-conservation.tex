(a) In the reaction $\text{p}+\text{e}^- \rightarrow  \text{n}+\nu $, the charges on the
left are $e+(-e)=0$, and both charges on the right are zero.
(b) The neutrino has negligible mass. The masses on the left
add up to $1.6736\times10^{-27}\ \kgunit$, which is less than the
$1.6750\times10^{-27}\ \kgunit$ mass of the neutron on the right,
so energy would be required from an external source in order
to make this reaction happen.
