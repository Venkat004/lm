Heating the gas at constant pressure requires
adding heat to it, which increases its entropy. To increase the gas's pressure
while keeping its temperature constant, we would have to compress it,
which would give it a smaller volume to inhabit, and therefore fewer possible
positions for each atom. The whole thing has to be proportional to $n$ because
entropy is additive.
