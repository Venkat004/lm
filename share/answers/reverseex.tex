(a) The energy density depends on $\zb{E}\cdot\zb{E}$, which equals
$E_x^2+E_y^2+E_z^2$.\\ (b) Since $E_x$ is squared, reversing its sign
has no effect on the energy density. This makes sense, because
otherwise we'd be saying that the positive and negative $x$ axes in
space were somehow physically different in their behavior, which
would violate the symmetry of space.
