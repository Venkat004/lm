(a) A liter of water has a mass of 1.0 kg. The mass is
the same in all three locations. Mass indicates how much an
object resists a change in its motion. It has nothing to do
with gravity. (b) The term ``weight'' refers to the force of
gravity on an object. The bottle's weight on earth is
$F_W=mg=9.8$ N. Its weight on the moon is about one
sixth that value, and its weight in interstellar space is zero.
