The equation, solved for $\theta$, is
$\theta=\sin^{-1}(m\lambda/d)$. The sine
function only ranges from $-1$ to $+1$, so
the inverse sine is undefined for
$|m\lambda/d|>1$, i.e., $|m|>d/\lambda$.
Physically, we only get fringes out to angles of
90 degrees (the inverse sine of 1) 
on both sides, corresponding to
values of $m$ less than $d/\lambda$.
