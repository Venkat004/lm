From the top panel of the figure, where the magnetic field is turned
off, we can see that the beam leaves the cathode traveling upward, so
in the bottom figure the electrons must be circlng in the
counterclockwise direction. To produce circular motion, the force
must be towards the center of the circle. We can arbitrarily pick a
point on the circle at which to analyze the vectors --- let's pick
the right-hand side. At this point, the velocity vector of the
electrons is upward. Since the electrons are negatively charged, the
force $q\zb{v}\times\zb{B}$ is given by $-\zb{v}\times\zb{B}$, not 
$+\zb{v}\times\zb{B}$. Circular orbits are produced when the motion
is in the plane perpendicular to the field, so the field must be
either into or out of the page. If the field was into the page, the
right-hand rule would give $\zb{v}\times\zb{B}$ to the left, which is
towards the center, but the force would be in the direction of
$-\zb{v}\times\zb{B}$, which would be outwards. The field must be out
of the page.
