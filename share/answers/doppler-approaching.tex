Both the time axis and the position axis have been turned around. Flipping the time axis
means that the roles of transmitter and receiver have been swapped, and it also means
that Alice and Betty are approaching one another rather that receding. The time experienced
by the receiving observer is now the longer one, so the Doppler-shift factor has been
inverted: the receiver now measures a Doppler shift of 1/2 rather than 2 in frequency.
