The analytic approach is a little cumbersome,
although it can be done  by using approximations like
$1/\sqrt{1+\epsilon}\approx1-(1/2)\epsilon$. A more straightforward, brute-force
method is simply to write a computer program that calculates $U/m$ for
a given point in spherical coordinates. By trial and error, you can fairly rapidly
find the $r$ that gives a desired value of $U/m$.
