The wind increases the ball's overall speed. If you think about it
 in terms of overall speed, it's not so obvious that
the increased speed is exactly sufficient to compensate for the greater distance. However, it becomes much
simpler if you think about the forward motion and the sideways motion as
 two separate things. Suppose the ball is
initially moving at one meter per second. Even if it picks
 up some sideways motion from the wind, it's still getting
closer to the wall by one meter every second.
