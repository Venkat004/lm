On the left-hand side, $\der N$ is a unitless count, and $\der t$ is an infinitesimal amount of
time, with units of seconds, so the units are $\sunit^{-1}$ as claimed. On the right, both
$N(0)$ and the exponential factor are unitless, so the only units come from the factor of $1/\tau$,
which again has units of $\sunit^{-1}$.
