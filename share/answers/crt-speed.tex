 (a) The change in PE is $e\Delta $V, so the KE gained is
$(1/2)mv^2=eV$. Solving for $v$, we get $v=\sqrt{2eV/m}$. (b) Plugging in numbers, the
velocity is  $5.9\times10^7$  m/s. This is about 20\% of the speed
of light. (Since it's not that close to the speed of light,
we'll get a reasonably accurate answer without taking into
account Einstein's theory of relativity.)
