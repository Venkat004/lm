The whole expression for the amplitude has maxima where the
stuff inside the square root is at a minimum, and vice versa, so
you can save yourself a lot of work by just working on the stuff
inside the square root. For normal, large values of $Q$, the
there are two extrema, one at $\omega=0$ and one at
resonance; one of these is a maximum and one is a minimum.
You want to find out at what value of $Q$ the zero-frequency extremum
switches over from being a maximum to being a minimum.
