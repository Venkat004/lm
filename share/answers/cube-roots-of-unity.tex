If $z^3=1$, then we know that $|z|=1$, since cubing $z$ cubes its magnitude. Cubing $z$ triples
its argument, so the argument of $z$ must be a number that, when tripled, is equivalent to an
angle of zero. There are three possibilities: $0\times 3=0$, $(2\pi/3)\times 3=2\pi$,
and $(4\pi/3)\times 3=4\pi$. (Other possibilities, such as $(32\pi/3)$, are equivalent to
one of these.) The solutions are:
\begin{equation*}
z = 1,\ e^{2\pi i/3},\ e^{4\pi i/3}
\end{equation*}
