(1) It's kinetic friction, because her uniform is sliding over
 the dirt. (2) It's static friction, because even though the
two surfaces are moving relative to the landscape, they're not slipping
 over each other. (3) Only kinetic friction
creates heat, as when you rub your hands together. If you
 move your hands up and down together without sliding
them across each other, no heat is produced by the static friction.
