(a) For a material object, $\vc{p}=m\vc{v}$. The velocity vector reverses
itself, but mass is still positive, so the momentum vector is reversed.\\
(b) In the forward-time universe, conservation of momentum is
$\vc{p}_{1,i}+\vc{p}_{2,i}=\vc{p}_{1,f}+\vc{p}_{2,f}$. In the backward-time
universe, all the momenta are reversed, but that just negates both sides
of the equation, so momentum is still conserved.
