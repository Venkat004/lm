The magnification is the ratio of the image's size to the
object's size. It has nothing to do with the person's
location. The angular magnification, however, does depend on
the person's location, because things farther away subtend
smaller angles. The distance to the actual object is not
changed significantly, since it's zillions of miles away in
outer space, but the distance to the image does change if
the observer's point of view changes. If you can get closer
to the image, the angular magnification is greater.
