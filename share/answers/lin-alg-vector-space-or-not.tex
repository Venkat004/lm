(a) The sketch for $\ell$ will be a 45-degree line through the origin, while $r$ will
be only the part of that line in the first quadrant. Of the two, only $\ell$ is
a vector space. The set $r$ isn't a vector space, because it doesn't have additive
inverses.\\
(b) We have $(1/2)(\pi+\pi)=0$, but $(1/2)\pi+(1/2)\pi=\pi$.
