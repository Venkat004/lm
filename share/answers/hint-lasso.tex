(a) The most straightforward approach is to apply the
equation $\partial^2y/\partial t^2=(T/\mu)\partial^2y/\partial x^2$.
Although this equation was developed in the main text in the
context of a straight string with a curvy wave on it, it works just
as well for a circular loop; the left-hand side is simply the inward
acceleration of any point on the rope. Note, however, that we've been
assuming the string was (at least approximately) parallel to the $x$ axis,
which will only be true if you choose a specific value of $x$.
You need to get an equation for
$y$ in terms of $x$ in order to evaluate the right-hand side.
