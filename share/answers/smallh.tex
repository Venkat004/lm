Under the ordinary circumstances of life, the accuracy with which we can measure position
and momentum of an object doesn't result in a value of $\Delta p\Delta x$ that is anywhere
 near the tiny order of magnitude of Planck's constant. We run up against the ordinary
 limitations on the accuracy of our measuring techniques long before the uncertainty
 principle becomes an issue.
