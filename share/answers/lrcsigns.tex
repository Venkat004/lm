Yes. The mass has the same kinetic energy regardless of which
direction it's moving. Friction coverts mechanical energy into heat
at the same rate whether the mass is sliding to the right or to the
left. The spring has an equilibrium length, and energy can be stored
in it either by compressing it ($x<0$) or stretching it ($x>0$).
