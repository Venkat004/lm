Any fractional change in $r$ results in double that
amount of fractional change in $1/r^2$. For example, raising
$r$ by 1\% causes $1/r^2$ to go down by very nearly 2\%. 
A 27-day orbit is 1/13.5 of a year, so
the fractional change in $1/r^2$ is
\begin{equation*}
 2 \times \frac{(1/13.5)\ \zu{cm}}{3.84\times10^5\ \zu{km}} 
   \times \frac{1\ \zu{km}}{10^5\ \zu{cm}}
 = 4\times10^{-12}
\end{equation*}
