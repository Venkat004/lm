This is similar to problem \ref{hw:atwood-energy-sn},
but you're trying to find the combination of masses that will result in \emph{zero}
acceleration. In this problem, the distance dropped
by one weight is different from, but still related to,
 the distance by which the other weight rises. Try relating the heights of the
 two weights to each other, so you can get the total gravitational energy in terms
 of only one of these heights.
