\egquestion The abstract sculpture shown in figure \figref{modern-art}
contains a cube of mass $m$ and sides of length $b$.
The cube rests on top of a cylinder, which is off-center by a distance $a$.
Find the tension in the cable.

\eganswer There are four forces on the cube:
a gravitational force $mg$, 
the force $F_T$ from the cable, the upward normal
force from the cylinder, $F_N$, and the horizontal static frictional force
from the cylinder, $F_s$.

The total force on the cube in the vertical direction is zero:
\begin{equation*}
  F_N-mg = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

As our axis for defining torques, let's choose the center of the cube.
The  cable's torque is counterclockwise,
the torque due to $F_N$ clockwise.
Letting counterclockwise torques be
positive, and using the convenient equation $\tau=r_\perp F$, we find
the equation for the total torque:
\begin{equation*}
  b F_T - aF_N = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
We could also write down the equation saying that the total horizontal
force is zero, but that would bring in the cylinder's frictional force
on the cube, which we don't know and don't need to find. We already have
two equations in the two unknowns $F_T$ and $F_N$, so there's no need
to make it into three equations in three unknowns.
Solving the first
equation for $F_N=mg$, we then substitute into the second equation
to eliminate $F_N$, and solve for $F_T=(a/b)mg$.

As a check, our result makes sense when $a=0$; the cube is balanced on the
cylinder, so the cable goes slack.
