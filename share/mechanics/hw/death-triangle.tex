Problem \ref{hw:climbing-anchors} discussed a possible correct way of setting up a redundant anchor for
mountaineering. The figure for this problem shows an incorrect way of doing it, by arranging the
rope in a triangle (which we'll take to be isoceles). One of the bad things about the triangular
arrangement is that it requires more force from the anchors, making them more likely to fail.
(a) Using the same notation as in problem \ref{hw:climbing-anchors},
find  $S$ in terms of $L$ and $\theta$.  \answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Verify that your answer makes sense in the case of $\theta=0$, and compare with the correct
setup.\hwendpart
