A person of mass $M$ is climbing a ladder of length $L$ and
negligible mass, propped up against a wall making an angle $\theta$
with respect to the horizontal. There is no friction between the
ladder and the wall, but there is a coefficient of static friction
$\mu_s$ between the ladder and the ground. What is the maximum
distance along the ladder that the person can reach before the ladder
starts to slide?
