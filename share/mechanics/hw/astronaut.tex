        A closed system can be a bad thing --- for an astronaut
        sealed inside a space suit, getting rid of body heat can be
        difficult. Suppose a 60-kg astronaut is performing vigorous
        physical activity, expending 200 W of power. If none of the
        heat can escape from her space suit, how long will it take
        before her body temperature rises by 6\degunit{}C (11\degunit{}F), an amount 
        sufficient to kill her?  Assume that the amount of heat
        required to raise her body temperature by 1\degunit{}C is the same as
        it would be for an equal mass of water. Express your answer
        in units of minutes. \answercheck
