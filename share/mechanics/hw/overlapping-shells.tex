The figure shows a region of outer space in which two stars have exploded, leaving behind two
overlapping spherical shells of gas, which we assume to remain at rest. The figure is a cross-section
in a plane containing the shells' centers. A space probe is released with a very small
initial speed at the point indicated by the arrow, initially moving in the direction
indicated by the dashed line. Without any further information, predict as much as possible
about the path followed by the probe and its changes in speed along that path.
