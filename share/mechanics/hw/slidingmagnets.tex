        (a) You release a magnet on a tabletop near a big piece
        of iron, and the magnet leaps across the table to the iron.
        Does the m4_ifelse(__pe,PE,[:magnetic potential energy:],[:magnetic energy:]) increase, or decrease?
        Explain. (b) Suppose instead that you have two repelling
        magnets. You give them an initial push towards each other,
        so they decelerate while approaching each other. Does the
        m4_ifelse(__pe,PE,[:magnetic potential energy:],[:magnetic energy:]) increase, or decrease? Explain.
