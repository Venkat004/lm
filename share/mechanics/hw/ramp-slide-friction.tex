A block of mass $m$ is at the top of a ramp of length $L$ inclined at
angle $\theta$ with respect to the horizontal. The block slides down
the ramp, and the coefficient of friction between the two surfaces is
$\mu_\text{k}$.\\

(a) What is the speed of the block when it reaches the bottom of the
ramp?\answercheck\hwendpart

(b) The speed of the block at the bottom of the ramp is only half of
what it would have been without friction. Knowing this, what is the
coefficient of friction $\mu_\text{k}$ in terms of the other given
quantities?\answercheck
