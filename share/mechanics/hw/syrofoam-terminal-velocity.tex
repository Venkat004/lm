A small piece of styrofoam packing material is dropped from rest at a
height $2.00\ \munit$ above the ground (call the moment it is dropped $t=0$).
The magnitude of its acceleration is given by $a = g - bv$, where $v$
is the speed of the styrofoam, $g = 9.8\ \munit/\sunit^2$, and $b$
is a positive constant (independent of $v$). After falling $0.500\ \munit$,
the styrofoam effectively reaches terminal speed and then takes 
$5.00\ \sunit$ more to reach the ground.\\

(a) What is the acceleration (magnitude and direction) when $t=0$?
What about when the styrofoam is halfway to the ground?\hwendpart
%
(b) Find the terminal speed of the styrofoam. \hwendpart
%
(c) What is the value of the constant $b$, with units?\hwendpart
%
(d) What is the acceleration when the speed is $0.150 \munit/\sunit$?

(e) Write $a = \der v/\der t$ and solve the differential equation for $v(t)$
(without plugging in numbers), and plot the result.
