A gasoline-powered car has a heavy wheel called a flywheel, whose main function
is to add inertia to the motion of the engine so that it keeps spinning smoothly
between power strokes of the cylinders.
Suppose that a certain car's flywheel is spinning with
angular velocity $\omega_0$, but the car is then turned off, so that the
engine and flywheel start to slow down as a result of friction. Assume that the
angular acceleration is constant. After the flywheel
has made $N$ revolutions, it comes to rest. What is the magnitude of
the angular acceleration?
