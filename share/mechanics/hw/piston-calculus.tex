 A pneumatic spring consists of a piston riding on top
of the air in a cylinder. The upward force of the air on
the piston is given by $F_{air}=ax^{-\beta}$, where $\beta=1.4$ and $a$ is a
constant with funny units of $\nunit\unitdot\munit^{1.4}$. For simplicity,
assume the air only supports the weight $mg$ of the
piston itself, although in practice this device is used to
support some other object. The equilibrium position, $x_0$,
is where $mg$ equals $-F_{air}$. (Note that in the main
text I have assumed the equilibrium position to be at $x=0$,
but that is not the natural choice here.) Assume friction
is negligible, and consider a case where the amplitude of
the vibrations is very small. Find the angular frequency of oscillation.\answercheck
