Let $a$ and $b$ be any two numbers (not both zero),
and let $\vc{u}=a\hat{\vc{x}}+b\hat{\vc{y}}$.
Suppose we want to find
a (nonzero) second vector $\vc{v}$ in the $x$-$y$ plane
that is perpendicular to $\vc{u}$.
Use the vector dot product to write down a condition
for $\vc{v}$ to satisfy, find a suitable $\vc{v}$,
and check using the dot product that it is indeed a solution.
