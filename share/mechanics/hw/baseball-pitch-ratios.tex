In college-level women's softball in the U.S., typically a pitcher is expected
to be at least 1.75 m tall, but Virginia Tech pitcher Jasmin Harrell is 1.62 m.
Although a pitcher actually throws by stepping forward and swinging her arm in
a circle, let's make a simplified physical model to estimate how much of a disadvantage
Harrell has had to overcome due to her height. We'll pretend that the pitcher gives the ball a constant acceleration
in a straight line, and that the length of this line is proportional to the pitcher's
height. Compare the acceleration Harrell would have to supply with the acceleration
that would suffice for a pitcher of the nominal
minimum height, if both were to throw a pitch at the same speed.\answercheck
