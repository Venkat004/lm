A 10-kg bowling ball moving at 2.0 m/s hits a 1.0-kg
bowling pin, which is initially at rest. The other pins are
all gone already, and the collision is head-on, so that the
motion is one-dimensional. Assume that negligible amounts of
heat and sound are produced. Find the velocity of the pin
immediately after the collision.
