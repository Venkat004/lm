Suppose we have a mass filament like the one described in problem
\ref{hw:g-field-of-straight-mass-filament}, but now rather than taking it to be
straight, let it have the shape of an arbitrary smooth curve. Locally, ``under a
microscope,'' this curve will look like an arc of a circle, i.e., we can describe its
shape solely in terms of a radius of curvature. 
Consider a point P lying \emph{on} the filament itself. If the filament was straight,
as in problem \ref{hw:g-field-of-straight-mass-filament}, with an infinite radius of
curvature, the field at P
would be zero by symmetry (not infinite as would be implied by letting $b=0$ in the
result of that problem). What can you say about the field at P when the radius of
curvature is finite?
