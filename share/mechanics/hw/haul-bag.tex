``Big wall'' climbing is a specialized type of rock climbing that involves going up
tall cliffs such as the ones in Yosemite, usually with the climbers spending at least
one night sleeping on a natural ledge or an artificial ``portaledge.''
In this style of climbing, each pitch of the climb involves strenuously hauling up several
heavy bags of gear --- a fact that has caused these climbs to be referred to as ``vertical
ditch digging.'' (a) If an 80 kg haul bag has to be pulled up the full length of a 60 m
rope, how much work is done? (b) Since it can be difficult to lift 80 kg, a 2:1 pulley is often
used. The hauler then lifts the equivalent of 40 kg, but has to pull in 120 m of rope.
How much work is done in this case?
