Blocks of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ rest, as shown in the figure, on a frictionless plane,
and are squeezed by forces of magnitude $F_1$ and $F_2$.\\
(a) Find the force $f$ that acts between the two blocks.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Check that your answer makes sense in the symmetric case where $F_1=F_2$
and $m_1=m_2$.\hwendpart
(c) Find the conditions under which your answer to part a gives $f=0$, and
check that it makes sense.\hwendpart
