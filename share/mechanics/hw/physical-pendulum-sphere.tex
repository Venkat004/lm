A pendulum with length $L$ has period $T$ when a very small mass is
placed at the end of it (with size much less than $L$). Suppose we do
not want to ignore the size of the bob. Consider a spherical bob with
radius $xL$ ($x$ is a dimensionless constant, and $L$ is the length
of the string, connecting the pivot to the center of the bob). The
period of motion of this physical pendulum is $T = 2\pi\sqrt{L/g}
f(x)$. What is $f(x)$? Your expression for $f(x)$ should satisfy
$f(0) = 1$. (Why?)\answercheck
