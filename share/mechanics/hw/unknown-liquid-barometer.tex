One way to measure the density of an unknown liquid is by
using it as a barometer. Suppose you have a column of length $L$ of
the unknown liquid (inside a vacuum tube), which provides the same
pressure as atmospheric pressure $P_0$.\\

Mercury barometers have $L = 760\ \zu{mm}$ at standard atmospheric pressure 
$P_0= 1.013 \times 10^5\ \zu{Pa}$. Given these data,
what is the density of mercury to three significant figures?\answercheck
