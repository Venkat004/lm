In a physics lecture, a student holds a bicycle wheel of moment of inertia $I$
while sitting on a stool that can spin. With her feet on the ground
so as not to move, she starts the wheel spinning with angular velocity
$\omega$ in the counterclockwise direction when looking down from above,
so that the angular velocity vector points towards the ceiling. She then picks
up her feet and turns the wheel over so that the rotation is reversed.  This
causes her to start rotating about the stool's axis of rotation. In the following,
take angular momenta to be positive if pointing vertically upwards and negative
if pointing vertically downwards.\\
