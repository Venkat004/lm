In a physics lecture, a student is holding a bicycle wheel having moment
of inertia $I$ while sitting on a stool that can spin. With her feet on the ground
so as not to move, she starts the wheel spinning with angular velocity
$\omega$ in the counterclockwise direction. She then picks up her feet
and turns the wheel over so that the rotation is reversed.  If this
causes her to start moving with an angular velocity of magnitude
$\omega/30$, what is the moment of inertia of her body plus the stool?\answercheck
