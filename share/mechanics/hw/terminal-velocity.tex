An object of mass $m$ is dropped from rest at time $t=0$. In addition
to its weight, the object feels a drag force given by $F_\text{drag}
= - k v$, where $v$ is the speed of the object and $k$ is a constant.\\
%
(a) What are the SI units of the combination $k/m$?\hwendpart
%
(b) By setting the acceleration of the object equal to zero when there
is a maximum drag force, find the terminal velocity of the object in
terms of $k$ and $m$.\hwendpart
%
(c) Find the velocity as a function of time.\hwendpart
%
(d) How long does it take until the object reaches half of the
terminal velocity found in part b?
