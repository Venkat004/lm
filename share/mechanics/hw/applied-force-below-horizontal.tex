A force $F$ is applied to a box of mass $M$ at an angle
$\theta$ below the horizontal (see figure). The coefficient of static
friction between the box and the floor is $\mu_\text{s}$, and the
coefficient of kinetic friction between the two surfaces is
$\mu_\text{k}$.\\

(a) What is the magnitude of the normal force on the box from the
floor?\hwendpart
%
(b) What is the minimum value of $F$ to get the box to
start moving from rest?\hwendpart
%
(c) What is the value of $F$ so that the box will move with
constant velocity (assuming it is already moving)?\hwendpart
%
(d) If $\theta$ is above some critical angle $\theta_\text{crit}$, it is impossible to have
the equilibrium scenario described in part (c). What is
$\theta_\text{crit}$?
