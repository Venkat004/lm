The figure shows a rock climber wedged into a dihedral or ``open book'' consisting
of two vertical walls of rock at an angle $\theta$ relative to one another.
This position can be maintained without any ledges or holds, simply by pressing
the feet against the walls. The left hand is being used just for a little bit
of balance. (a) Find the minimum coefficient of friction between the rubber climbing
shoes and the rock. (b) Interpret the behavior of your expression at extreme values of
$\theta$. (c) Steven Won has done tabletop experiments using climbing shoes on the
rough back side of a granite slab from a kitchen countertop, and has estimated
$\mu_s=1.17$. Find the corresponding maximum value of $\theta$.
