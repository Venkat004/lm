Consider the system shown in the figure. Block A has mass $M_A$
and block B has mass $M_B$. There is friction between the table 
and block A. Once block B is set into downward motion, it
descends at a constant speed.\\
%
(a) Analyze the forces in which each block participates as described
in m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:section \ref{sec:newton-2-analysis-of-forces}:],[:__subsection_or_section(analysis-of-forces):])\hwendpart
%
(b) Calculate the coefficient of kinetic friction between block A and
the tabletop.\answercheck\hwendpart

(c) A sloth, also of mass $M_A$, falls asleep on top of block A. If
block B is now set into downward motion, what is its acceleration
(magnitude and direction)?\answercheck
