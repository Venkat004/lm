The figure shows a tabletop experiment that can be used to determine
an unknown moment of inertia. A rotating platform of radius $R$ has
a string wrapped around it. The string is threaded over a pulley and
down to a hanging weight of mass $m$. The mass is released from rest,
and its downward acceleration $a$ ($a>0$) is measured. Find the total moment of inertia
$I$ of the platform plus the object sitting on top of it.
(The moment of inertia of the object itself can then be found by
subtracting the value for the empty platform.)\answercheck
