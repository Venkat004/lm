Estimate the pressure at the center of the Earth,
assuming it is of constant density throughout. 
m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:%
The gravitational field $g$ is not constant with repsect to
depth. It equals $Gmr/b^3$ for $r$, the distance from the center,
less than $b$, the earth's radius. Here $m$ is the mass of the earth, and
$G$ is Newton's universal gravitational constant, which has units
of $\nunit\unitdot\munit^2/\kgunit^2$.%:],[:Note that $g$
is not constant with respect to depth --- as shown in
example \ref{eg:gravityinearth} on page \pageref{eg:gravityinearth},
$g$ equals $Gmr/b^3$ for $r$, the distance from the center,
less than $b$, the earth's radius.%:])

(a) State your result in terms of $G$, $m$, and $b$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Show that your answer from part a has the right units for pressure.\hwendpart
(c) Evaluate the result numerically. \answercheck \hwendpart
(d) Given that the earth's atmosphere is on the order of
 one thousandth the earth's radius, and that the density
of the earth is several thousand times greater than the density of the
lower atmosphere, check that your result is of a reasonable order of
magnitude.
