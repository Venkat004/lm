The earth moves about the sun in an elliptical orbit where angular
momentum about the sun is conserved. Earth's distance from the sun
ranges from 0.983 AU (at perihelion, the closest point) to 1.017
AU (at aphelion, the farthest point). The AU is a unit of distance. If the orbital speed of
Earth at aphelion is $v$, what is the orbital speed of Earth at
perihelion?
