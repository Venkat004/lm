Problem \ref{hw:lowering-climber}, p.~\pageref{hw:lowering-climber},
which has a solution in the back of the book, was an analysis of
the forces acting on a rock climber being lowered back down on the rope.
Expand that analysis into a table in the format shown in m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:section \ref{sec:newton-2-analysis-of-forces}:],[:__subsection_or_section(analysis-of-forces):]),
which includes the types of the forces and their Newton's-third-law partners.
