Problem \ref{hw:lowering-climber}, p.~\pageref{hw:lowering-climber},
which has a solution in the back of the book, was an analysis of
the forces acting on a rock climber being lowered back down on the rope.
Expand that analysis into a table in the format shown in section \ref{sec:analysis-of-forces},
which includes the types of the forces and their Newton's-third-law partners.
