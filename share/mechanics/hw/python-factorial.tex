  The factorial of an integer $n$, written $n!$, is defined as the product of all the
  positive integers less than or equal to $n$. For example, $3!=1\times2\times3=6$.
  Write a Python program to compute the factorial of a number.
  Test it with a small number whose factorial you can check by hand.
  Then use it to compute $30!$. (Python computes integer results with
  unlimited precision, so you won't get any problems with rounding or overflows.)
  Turn in a printout of your program and its output, including the test.
