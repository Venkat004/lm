Suppose you can hit a tennis ball vertically upwards with some maximum
speed $v_0$, independent of what planet you're on.\\
(a) If the maximum height the ball reaches on Earth is $H$, what is
the maximum height the ball will reach on Pluto, where the
acceleration due to gravity is about 1/15th the value on Earth?\hwendpart
(b) If the amount of time the ball spends in the air on Earth is 3.0
seconds, how long would it spend in the air on Pluto?
