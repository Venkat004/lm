The two masses are identical.
Find the upward acceleration of the mass on the right, in terms of $g$ only.
Assume all the ropes and
pulleys, as well as the cross-bar, are massless, and the pulleys are frictionless.
The right-hand mass has been positioned away from the bar's center, so that the
bar will not twist.

Hints: (1) Use rules 1-3 on p.~\pageref{pulley-rules}.
(2) The approach is similar to the one in problem \ref{hw:atwood},
but the ratio of the accelerations isn't 1:1.\answercheck
