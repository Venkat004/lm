A little kid in my neighborhood came home from shopping
with his mother. They live on a hill, with their driveway oriented
perpendicular to the slope. Their minivan was parked in the driveway, and
while she was bringing groceries inside, he unlocked the
parking brake and put the car in neutral. The steering wheel was locked with the
wheels banked.
The car rolled downhill in a circular arc with the driveway
at its top, eventually crashing through the
wall of a neighbor's living room. (Nobody was hurt.) Suppose the neighbor's house hadn't intervened.
The car just rolls freely, and we want to know whether it will
ever skid. Static friction acts between the asphalt and the tires with coefficient
$\mu_s$, the radius of the circle is $r$, the slope of the hill is $\theta$,
and the gravitational field has strength $g$. Find the maximum value of $\theta$
such that the car will never skid.
