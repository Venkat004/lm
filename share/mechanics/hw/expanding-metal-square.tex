A metal square expands and contracts with temperature, the lengths of its sides varying according to the
equation $\ell=(1+\alpha T)\ell_\zu{o}$. Infer the units of $\alpha$. Find the rate of change of its surface area with respect to
temperature. That is, find $\der A/\der T$.  
Check that your answer has the right units, as in example \ref{eg:pest} on page \pageref{eg:pest}.\answercheck
