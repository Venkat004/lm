A mass moving in one dimension is attached to a horizontal spring. It
slides on the surface below it, with equal coefficients of static
and kinetic friction, $\mu_k=\mu_s$.
The equilibrium position is $x=0$. If the mass is pulled to some initial
position and released from rest, it will complete some number of oscillations
before friction brings it to a stop. When released from
$x=a$ ($a>0$), it completes exactly 1/4 of an oscillation, i.e., it
stops precisely at $x=0$. Similarly, define $b>0$ as the greatest $x$
from which it could be released and comlete 1/2 of an oscillation, stopping
on the far side and not coming back toward equilibrium.
Find $b/a$. Hint: To keep the algebra simple, set every fixed parameter
of the system equal to 1.\answercheck
