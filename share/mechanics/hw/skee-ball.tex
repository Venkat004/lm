The figure shows an arcade game called skee ball that is similar to bowling.
The player rolls the ball down a horizontal alley. The ball then rides up
a curved lip and is launched at an initial speed $u$, at an angle $\alpha$
above horizontal. Suppose we want the ball to go into a hole that is at horizontal
distance $\ell$ and height $h$, as shown in the figure.\\
(a) Find the initial speed $u$ that is required, in terms of the other variables and $g$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Check that your answer to part a has units that make sense.\hwendpart
(c) Check that your answer to part a depends on $g$ in a way that makes sense. This means
that you should first determine on physical grounds whether increasing $g$ should increase
$u$, or decrease it. Then see whether your answer to part a has this mathematical behavior.\hwendpart
(d) Do the same for the dependence on $h$.\hwendpart
(e) Interpret your equation in the case where $\alpha=90\degunit$.\hwendpart
(f) Interpret your equation in the case where $\tan\alpha=h/\ell$.\hwendpart
(g) Find $u$ numerically if $h=70\ \zu{cm}$, $\ell=60\ \zu{cm}$, and $\alpha=65\degunit$.\answercheck\hwendpart
