C\'esar is on one bank of a river in which the water flows at speed $w$.
He can swim at speed $u$ and run at speed $v$. On the other side, directly
across from him, is a town that he wants to reach in the minimum possible
time. Depending on the direction in which he chooses to swim, he may need
to run some distance along the far bank in order to get to the town.
Show that, surprisingly, the optimal angle depends on the variables $v$ and $w$ only
through their sum $v+w$.
