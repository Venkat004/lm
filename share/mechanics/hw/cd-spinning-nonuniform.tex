A CD is initially moving counterclockwise with angular speed $\omega_0$ and then starts
decelerating with an angular acceleration of magnitude $\alpha$.\\
%
(a) How long does it take for the CD to come to rest?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) Suppose that, after a time equal to half that found in part a,
point on the CD satisfies $|a_r|=|a_t|$.
If the initial angular velocity of the CD was $40\ \sunit^{-1}$, what is the
total time it takes for the CD to come to rest (i.e., the numerical
value of your answer in part a)?\answercheck
