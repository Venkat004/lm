A roller-coaster car of mass $m$ starts from rest at the top of a
ramp, slides down, and enters the vertical, circular
``loop-the-loop'' of radius $R$ shown in the figure. The speed of the
roller coaster at the top of the loop-the-loop is twice the minimum
value required so that the roller-coaster doesn't fall.\\
