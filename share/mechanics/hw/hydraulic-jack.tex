The figure shows a schematic diagram of a car on a hydraulic lift.
The small piston has diameter $d$ and the large one $D$.
Any difference in height between the two sides is not enough to
create a significant difference in pressure due to gravity.\\

(a) If we would like to lift a car of mass $M$, what force is
required at the piston end?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) If we would like to lift the car by a distance $L$, how far does
the piston need to move? Assume that the fluid is incompressible, so that its
volume is conserved.\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(c) By considering the work done in lifting the car,
verify that your answers to part a and b are consistent with conservation
of energy.
