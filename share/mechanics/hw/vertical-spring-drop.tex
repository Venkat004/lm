A box of mass $M$ is dropped from a height $H$ above the ground onto
a spring oriented vertically with equilibrium length $x_0$ (the
platform has negligible mass). The spring has spring constant $k$.\\
%
(a) What is the final compression length of the spring? Your answer
requires the quadratic equation; to choose the correct root, note
that $x$ needs to be positive.\answercheck\hwendpart

(c) What is the maximum speed of the box? \emph{Hint: the box speeds
up until the force from the spring equals the gravitational force.}\answercheck
