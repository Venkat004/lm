As shown in the figure, A box of mass $M$ is dropped from a height $H$ above the ground onto
a spring with equilibrium length $x_0$. The
platform has negligible mass. The spring has spring constant $k$.\\

(a) What is the final compressed length of the spring? Your answer
requires the quadratic equation; to choose the correct root, note
that $x$ needs to be positive.\answercheck\hwendpart
