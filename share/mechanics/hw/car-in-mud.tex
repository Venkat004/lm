The figure shows a man trying to push his car out of the mud. (a) Suppose that he isn't
able to move the car. Analyze the forces in which the \emph{car} participates,
using a table in the format shown in m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:section \ref{sec:newton-2-analysis-of-forces}:],[:__subsection_or_section(analysis-of-forces):]).
(b) In the situation described above, compare the strengths of the forces to each other.
(c) The man takes a nap, eats some chocolate, and now feels stronger. Now he is
able to move the car, and the car is currently
moving at constant speed. Discuss the strengths of the forces at this time, in relation to one
another.
(d) The man gets tired again. He is still pushing, but the car, although still moving, begins to decelerate.
Again, discuss the strengths of the forces in relation to one another.
