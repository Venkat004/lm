The figure shows a man trying to push his car out of the mud. (a) Suppose that he isn't
able to move the car. Analyze the forces in which the \emph{car} participates,
using a table in the format shown in m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:section \ref{sec:newton-2-analysis-of-forces}:],[:__subsection_or_section(analysis-of-forces):]).
(b) Suppose instead that the man is able to move the car, and the car is currently
moving at constant speed. Discuss the strengths of the forces in relation to one
another, and compare with what happened in part a.
(c) The man gets tired. He is still pushing, but the car, although still moving, begins to decelerate.
Discuss this as in part b.
