(a) The two identical rods are attached to one another with a hinge, and
are supported by the two massless cables. Find the angle $\alpha$ in terms of the
angle $\beta$, and show that the result is a purely geometric one, independent of
the other variables involved.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Using your answer to part a, sketch the configurations for $\beta\rightarrow 0$,
$\beta= 45\degunit$, and $\beta= 90\degunit$. Do your results
make sense intuitively?
