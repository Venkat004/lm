Lisa times herself running up the stairs of her science building
and finds that it takes her $23\ \sunit$ to reach
the top floor. Her mass is $44\ \kgunit$. If the vertical
height reached is $11.0\ \munit$, what is minimum average power she would have to have
exerted during the climb (i.e., only taking into account the energy
required to overcome gravity)?
