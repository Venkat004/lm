Two spherical objects, both of mass $m$ and radius $R$, have
center-to-center separation $4R$ and are initially at rest. No external 
forces act. The
spheres accelerate towards one another until they collide.\\
%
(a) What is the speed of each object just before the collision?
Find the exact answer using energy methods.\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) Using the final speed from part (a), and
assuming the acceleration is roughly constant and equal to the
initial acceleration, calculate an upper limit on the time it takes
for the two objects to collide. (The actual time will be shorter,
because the acceleration increases as they get closer.)\answercheck\hwendpart

(c) Calculate a numerical value of the time from part b, in the
case of two bowling balls having $m = 7\ \kgunit$ and $R = 0.1\ \munit$.\answercheck\hwendpart
