A border collie and a rottweiler, both initially at the same
location, start chasing two different objects. The border collie
starts chasing a stick thrown in the $\hat{\vc{x}} + \hat{\vc{y}}$ direction, and
the rottweiler starts chasing your neighbor in the $-\hat{\vc{y}}$
direction. Both dogs move at speed $v$. For both parts of this problem,
give your results as exact expressions, not decimal approximations.\\
