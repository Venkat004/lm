A baseball pitcher throws a fastball. Her hand accelerates the ball from
rest to $45.0\ \munit/\sunit$ over a distance $1.5$ meters. For the purposes
of this problem, we will make the simplifying assumption that this acceleration
is constant.

(c) If home plate is 18.0 meters away from where the pitcher releases
the baseball, how much total time does the baseball take to get there, assuming
it moves with constant velocity as soon as it leaves the pitcher's
hand? Include both the time required for acceleration and the time the ball
spends on the fly.\answercheck
