At a picnic, someone hands you a can of beer. The ground is uneven,
and you don't want to spill your drink. You reason that it will be
more stable if you drink some of it first in order to lower its
center of mass. How much should you drink in order to make the center
of mass as low as possible? [Based on a problem by Walter van B. Roberts and
Martin Gardner.]
