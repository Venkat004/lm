On an airless body such as the moon, there is  no atmospheric friction, so it
  should be possible for a satellite to orbit at a very low   
  altitude, just high enough to keep from hitting the
  mountains.
(a) Suppose that such a body is a smooth sphere of uniform density $\rho$ and
radius $r$. Find the velocity required for a ground-skimming orbit.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) A typical asteroid has a density of about $2\ \zu{g}/\zu{cm}^3$, i.e., twice that of
water. (This is a lot lower than the density of the earth's crust, probably indicating that
the low gravity is not enough to compact the material very tightly, leaving lots of empty
space inside.) Suppose that it is possible for an astronaut in a spacesuit to jump at
$2\ \munit/\sunit$. Find the radius of the largest asteroid on which it would be possible
to jump into a ground-skimming orbit.\answercheck
