A ramp of length $L$ is inclined at angle $\theta$ to the horizontal.
You would like to push your backpack to the top of the ramp. The
coefficient of kinetic friction between the backpack and the ramp is
$\mu_\text{k}$, and you will push the backpack with a force of
magnitude $F$.\\

(b) How long will it take the backpack to reach the top of the ramp if
you apply your push parallel to the the ground? (Your push is such
that there is a component along the ramp and a component into the
ramp.)
