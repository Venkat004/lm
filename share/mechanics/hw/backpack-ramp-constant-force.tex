A ramp of length $L$ is inclined at angle $\theta$ to the horizontal.
You would like to push your backpack, which has mass $m$, to the top of the ramp. The
coefficient of kinetic friction between the backpack and the ramp is
$\mu_\text{k}$, and you will push the backpack with a force of
magnitude $F$.\\
