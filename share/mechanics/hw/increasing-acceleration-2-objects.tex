Objects A and B move along the $x$ axis. The acceleration of
both objects as functions of time is given by $a(t) =
(3.00\ \munit/\sunit^3)t$. Object A
starts (at $t=0$) from rest at the origin, and object B starts at $x
= 5.00\ \munit$, initially moving in the negative $x$ direction with speed
$9.00\ \munit/\sunit$.\\
(a) What is A's velocity at time $t = 2.00\ \sunit$?\answercheck\hwendpart

(b) What is A's position at the same time?\answercheck\hwendpart

(c) What is B's velocity at the same time?\answercheck\hwendpart

(d) What is B's position at the same time?\answercheck\hwendpart

(e) Consider a frame of reference in which A is at rest, such as the frame that would
naturally be adopted by an observer moving along with A. Describe B's motion in this frame.\hwendpart

(f) After they start, is there any time at which A and B collide?
