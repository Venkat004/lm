Two objects (A and B) move along the $x$ axis. The acceleration of
both objects as a function of time is given by $a(t) =
(3.00\ \munit/\sunit^3)t$, where $t$ is in seconds. Object A
starts (at $t=0$) from rest at the origin, and object B starts at $x
= 5.00\ \munit$, initially moving in the negative $x$ direction with speed
$9.00\ \munit/\sunit$.\\
