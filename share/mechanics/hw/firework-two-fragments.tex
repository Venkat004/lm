A $5.00\ \kgunit$ firework is launched straight up into the air. When
it reaches its maximum height of $H = 140\ \munit$, it explodes into two
fragments that fly off in horizontal directions. The explosion is
very quick, and only lasts $15\ \zu{ms}$. One of the two fragments
(fragment A, with mass $M_A = 2.00\ \kgunit$) lands 290 meters away from
the initial launch position.\\
