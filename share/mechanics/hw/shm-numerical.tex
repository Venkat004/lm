A spring is attached to a wall as shown (the horizontal surface is
frictionless). One fact is known about the spring: when compressed a
distance 11.0 cm, the spring holds $1.00\ \junit$ of elastic
potential energy.\\
%
(a) What mass $M$ must be attached to the spring so that it will
oscillate with a period of $1.00\ \sunit$?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) If the amplitude of the motion is 5.00 cm and the period is that
specified in part a, where is the object (relative to equilibrium)
and in what direction is it moving $0.35\ \sunit$ after it has passed
the equilibrium position, moving to the left?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(c) At the instant described in part b, what are the kinetic and
potential energies of the system?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(d) What force (magnitude and direction) does the spring exert on
mass $M$ when it is 3.00 cm to the right of the equilibrium position,
moving to the right?
