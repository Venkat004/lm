The tires used in Formula 1 race cars can generate traction (i.e., force from the road) that
is as much as 1.9 times greater than with the tires typically used
in a passenger car. Suppose that we're trying to see how fast a car
can cover a fixed distance starting from rest, and traction is the
limiting factor. By what factor is this time reduced when switching
from ordinary tires to Formula 1 tires?\answercheck
