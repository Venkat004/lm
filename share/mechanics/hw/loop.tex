        A plane is flown in a loop-the-loop of radius 1.00 km.
        The plane starts out flying upside-down, straight and level,
        then begins curving up along the circular loop, and is
        right-side up when it reaches the top. (The plane may slow
        down somewhat on the way up.) How fast must the plane be
        going at the top if the pilot is to experience no force from
        the seat or the seatbelt while at the top of the loop? \answercheck
