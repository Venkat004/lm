(a) Express the chain rule in Leibniz (``d'') notation, and show that it always results in an answer whose
units make sense.\hwendpart
(b) An object has a  position as a function of time
given by $x=A\cos(bt)$, where $A$ and $b$ are constants.
Infer the units of $A$ and $b$, and interpret their physical meanings.\hwendpart
(c) Find the velocity of this object, and check that the chain rule has indeed given an answer with
the right units.\hwendpart
