Mountain climbers with masses $m$ and $M$ are roped together while crossing
a horizontal glacier when a vertical crevasse opens up under the climber with mass $M$.
The climber with mass $m$ drops down on the snow and tries to stop by digging
into the snow with the pick of an ice ax. Alas, this story does not have a
happy ending, because this doesn't provide enough friction to stop. Both $m$ and $M$
continue accelerating, with $M$ dropping down into the crevasse and $m$ being dragged
across the snow, slowed only by the kinetic friction with coefficient $\mu_k$ acting
between the ax and the snow. There is no significant friction between the rope and the
lip of the crevasse.\\
(a) Find the acceleration $a$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Check the units of your result.\hwendpart
(c) Check the dependence of your equation on the variables. That means that for each
variable, you should determine what its effect on $a$ should be physically, and then
what your answer from part a says its effect would be mathematically.
