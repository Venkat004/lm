Block $A$ (of mass $M_A$) rests on a frictionless horizontal table.
It is connected via a light string to block $B$ (of mass $M_B$)
hanging over the edge of the table. The pulley itself, a solid disc,
has non-negligible mass $M_C$. The light string does not slip over
the pulley. What is the magnitude of the linear acceleration of the
system?
