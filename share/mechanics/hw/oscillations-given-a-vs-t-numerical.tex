On a frictionless, horizontal air track, a glider oscillates at the
end of an ideal spring of force constant $150\ \nunit/\munit$. The
graph shows the acceleration of the glider as a function of time.\\
%
(a) Find the period of oscillations and the mass of the glider.\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) Notice that the graph says that the maximum acceleration of the glider
is $12.0\ \munit/\sunit^2$. Use this to find the amplitude of
oscillations, $A$.\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(c) When the glider is $A/3$ away from its equilibrium position,
what are its kinetic and potential energies?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(d) Suppose $x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$, where $0\le \phi < 2\pi$. Find $\phi$.\answercheck
