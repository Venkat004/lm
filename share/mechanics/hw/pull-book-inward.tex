A book is spinning around a circle of radius $R$ on top of a flat
tabletop. The speed of the book is initially $v_0$. The inward
force is provided by a string attached to the book, going through a
hole at the center of the circle ($r=0$), and passing
underneath to a person holding the string. The person pulls on
the string so that the book spirals inward,
eventually cutting the radius of the circular motion in half.\\

\noindent (The string's force exerts no torque on the book, since it is
always in the direction towards the hole. The force, however,
can have a non-zero component tangential to the book's motion, because the book
spirals in toward the hole. This is why the answer to part b is
nonzero.)
