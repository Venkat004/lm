\answercheck You are driving your car, and you hit a brick wall head
on, at full speed. The car has a mass of 1500 kg. The
kinetic energy released is a measure of how much destruction
will be done to the car and to your body. Calculate the
energy released if you are traveling at (a) 40 mi/hr, and
again (b) if you're going 80 mi/hr. What is counterintuitive
about this, and what implication does this have for
driving at high speeds?
