A mass $M$ is at rest on a fixed ramp inclined at angle $\theta$ with
respect to the horizontal. It is connected via a string and pulley to
a block of unknown mass $m$ hanging over the side of the ramp.\\
%
(a) If there is no friction between $M$ and the ramp, find the
value of $m$ so that the two blocks are in equilibrium.\hwendpart
%
(b) If there is a coefficient of static friction $\mu_\text{s}$
between the block and the interface, find the minimum and maximum
values that $m$ can take so that the blocks remain at rest.
