Two wheels of radius $r$ rotate in the same vertical plane with
angular velocities $+\Omega$ and $-\Omega$ (rates of rotation in radians per second) about axes that are
parallel and at the same height. The wheels touch one another at a point on
their circumferences, so that their rotations mesh like gears in a gear train.
A board is laid on top of the wheels, so that two friction forces act upon it,
one from each wheel. Characterize the three  qualitatively different types
of motion that the board can exhibit, depending on the initial conditions.
