The figure shows the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS orbits the earth once every
92.6 minutes. It is desirable to keep the same side of the station always oriented toward the
earth, which means that the station has to rotate with the same period. In the photo, the
direction of orbital motion is left or right on the page, so the rotation is about the
axis shown as up and down on the page. The greatest distance of any pressurized compartment
from the axis of rotation is 36.5 meters. Find the acceleration, and the apparent weight of
a 60 kg astronaut at that location.\answercheck
