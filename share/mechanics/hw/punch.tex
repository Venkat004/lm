Engineering professor Qingming Li used sensors and video cameras to study 
punches delivered in the lab by British former welterweight
boxing champion Ricky ``the Hitman'' Hatton. For comparison, Li
also let a TV sports reporter put on the gloves and throw punches. The time it took for
Hatton's best punch to arrive, i.e., the time his opponent would have 
had to react, was about $0.47$ of that for the reporter.
Let's assume that the fist starts from rest and moves with constant
acceleration all the way up until impact, at some fixed distance
(arm's length). Compare Hatton's acceleration to the reporter's.\answercheck
