Can the vector cross product be generalized to four dimensions?
The generalization should, like the three-dimensional version,
take two vectors as inputs, give a vector as an output, and be
rotationally invariant.
(This is of real-world interest because Einstein's theory of relativity
can be interpreted as describing time as a kind of fourth dimension.)
