The figure above is from a classic 1920 physics textbook
by Millikan and Gale. It represents a method for raising the
water from the pond up to the water tower, at a higher level,
without using a pump. Water is allowed into the drive pipe,
and once it is flowing fast enough, it forces the valve at the
bottom closed. Explain how this works in terms of conservation
of mass and energy. (Cf. example \ref{eg:faucet} on page \pageref{eg:faucet}.)
