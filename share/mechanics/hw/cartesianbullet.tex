A gun is aimed horizontally to the west. The gun is fired, and the bullet leaves the muzzle at
$t=0$. The bullet's position vector as a function of time is
$\vc{r}=b\hat{\vc{x}}+ct\hat{\vc{y}}+dt^2\hat{\vc{z}}$, where $b$, $c$, and $d$ are 
positive constants.\hwendpart
 %
 (a) What units would
$b$, $c$, and $d$ need to have for the equation to make sense?\hwendpart
 %
(b) Find the bullet's velocity and acceleration as functions
of time.\hwendpart
 %
 (c) Give physical interpretations of $b$, $c$, $d$, $\hat{\vc{x}}$, $\hat{\vc{y}}$, and $\hat{\vc{z}}$.
