Two speedboats are identical, but one has more people aboard than the
other. Although the total masses of the two boats are unequal, suppose
that they happen to have the same kinetic energy. In a boat, as in a car,
it's important to be able to stop in time to avoid hitting things.
(a) If the frictional force from the water is the same in both cases,
how will the boats' stopping distances
compare? Explain. (b) Compare the times required for the boats to stop.
