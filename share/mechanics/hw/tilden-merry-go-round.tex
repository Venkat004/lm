A bell rings at the Tilden Park merry go round in Berkeley, California,
and the carousel begins to move with an angular acceleration of
$1.0\times10^{-2}\ \sunit^{-2}$. How much times does it take to perform
its first revolution?\answercheck

% timed two successive revolutions, giraffe in front
% The algebraic expression for alpha below is approximate.
% calc -e "t1=20.9 s; t2=13.5 s; alpha=(2pi/t2-2pi/t1)/[(t1+t2)/2]"
%     t1 = 20.9 s
%     t2 = 13.5 s
%     alpha = 9.58082894904346*10^-3 s-2
