You race a hoop, a solid sphere, and a solid cylinder down
an incline of angle $\theta$ with respect to the horizontal. Each
object rolls without slipping.\\

(a) What is the linear acceleration of the center of mass of the
hoop?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) The solid sphere?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(c) The solid cylinder?\answercheck

\noindent Note this problem is easier if you don't do each part
separately, but rather say that $I = c MR^2$, and plug in different
values of $c$ at the very end of the calculation.
