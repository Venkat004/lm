An airport has a moving walkway to help people move across and/or
between terminals quickly. Suppose that you're walking north on such
a walkway, where the walkway has speed $3.0\ \munit/\sunit$ relative
to the airport, and you walk at a speed of $2.0\ \munit/\sunit$. You
pass by your friend, who is off the walkway, traveling 
south at $1.5\ \munit/\sunit$.\\
