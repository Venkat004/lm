You're running off a cliff into a pond. The cliff is $h=5.0\ \munit$ above the
water, but the cliff is not strictly vertical; it slopes down to the
pond at an angle of $\theta=20\degunit$ with respect to the vertical. 
You want to find
the minimum speed you need to jump off the cliff in order to land
in the water.\\

(c) Check that the dependence on the variables $g$, $h$, and $\theta$ makes sense, and
check the special cases $\theta=0$ and $\theta=90\degunit$.\hwendpart
