Debbie is in Los Angeles, at a distance $r = 5280\ \zu{km}$ from the
Earth's axis of rotation.\\

(a) What is Debbie's speed (as measured by an observer not
moving relative to the center of the Earth)?\hwendpart
%
(b) What is Debbie's acceleration? Your answer
indicates to what extent the apparent acceleration due to gravity is
modified when not at one of the poles. For reference, 
$g = 9.81\ \munit / \sunit^2$ at the poles, but appears slightly less near the
equator.
