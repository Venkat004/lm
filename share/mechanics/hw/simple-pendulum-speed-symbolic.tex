A simple pendulum of length $L$ is released from from angle $\theta$.
Solve for the maximum speed of the pendulum bob two ways:\\
%
(a) Exactly, by using conservation of energy.\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) Approximately, by assuming $\theta \ll 1$, using $|v_\text{max}|
= A\omega$, and writing $A$ and $\omega$ in terms of the given
quantities. Your result is the first non-zero term in the Taylor
expansion of the exact answer around $\theta = 0$.\answercheck
