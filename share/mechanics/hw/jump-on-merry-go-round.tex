A merry-go-round consists of a uniform disc of mass $M$.
It spins around at $N$
revolutions per minute. Mary, who also has mass $M$, is thinking about
jumping on.\\
%
(a) What is the initial angular velocity of the merry-go-round (in
terms of $N$ alone)?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) Suppose Mary jumps on the merry-go-round at the edge with
negligible initial velocity. How many revolutions per minute does the
merry-go-round make?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(c) Suppose that, instead of jumping on the edge with no initial
velocity, Mary wants to jump onto the edge (tangent to the disc) such
that the merry-go-round is at rest right after jumping on. Express
your answer in terms of the radius of the merry-go-round, $R$,
and the initial angular velocity of the merry-go-round, $\omega$.
