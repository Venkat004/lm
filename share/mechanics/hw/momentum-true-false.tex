Decide whether the following statements about
one-dimensional motion are true or false:\\
%
(a) The momentum transferred to an object is equal to the final momentum
of the object.\hwendpart
%
(b) The momentum delivered to an object by a force $F$ is equal to the
average force on the object multiplied by the time over which the
force acts on the object.\hwendpart
%
(c) Momentum transfer has the same dimensions as force (SI units of
newtons).\hwendpart
%
(d) The area underneath a momentum-vs-time graph gives the average
force delivered to an object.
