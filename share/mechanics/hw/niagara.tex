Two daredevils, Wendy and Bill, go over Niagara Falls.
Wendy sits in an inner tube, and lets the 30 km/hr velocity
of the river throw her out horizontally over the falls. Bill
paddles a kayak, adding an extra 10 km/hr to his velocity.
They go over the edge of the falls at the same moment, side
by side. Ignore air friction. Explain your reasoning.\hwendpart
