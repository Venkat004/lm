A car exits the freeway via a circular off-ramp. The road is
level (i.e., the curve is not banked at all), and the
radius of curvature of the circular ramp is $1.00 \times 10^2\ \munit$.
The coefficient of friction between the tires and the road is
$\mu = 0.8$.\\

(a) What is the maximum possible speed the car can travel on the
offramp without slipping?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
For parts (b) through (d), the car is traveling at
$20.0\ \munit/\sunit$ and decelerating at a rate of 
$3.0\ \munit/\sunit^2$. The car is turning to the right.\\

(b) What is the absolute value of the radial component of the acceleration?
What is the magnitude of the acceleration vector?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(c) There is a pine-scented tree hanging
from the rear view mirror. During the curve, the tree does not hang vertically.
Describe in
words which way the tree swings. Does it appear to lean left, or right?
Forward, or backward? An analysis of the forces might help in your explanation.\hwendpart

(d) What angle does the tree make with respect to the
vertical?\answercheck
