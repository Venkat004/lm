A car exits the freeway via a circular off-ramp. The road is
horizontally level (i.e., the curve is not banked at all), and the
radius of curvature of the circular ramp is $1.00 \times 10^2\ \munit$.
The coefficient of friction between the tires and the road is
$\mu = 0.8$. For parts (b) through (d), the car is traveling at
$20.0\ \munit/\sunit$ and decelerating at a rate of 
$5.0\ \munit/\sunit^2$. For definiteness, you're turning to the right to
follow the road.\\

(a) What is the maximum possible speed the car can travel on the
offramp without slipping?\hwendpart
%
(b) What is is the radial component of the acceleration of the car?
What is the tangential component of the acceleration of the car? What
is the total acceleration of the car? (just the magnitude is okay for
each.)\hwendpart
%
(c) Suppose the driver just bought a pine-scented tree that is hanging
from her rear view mirror. The tree does not just hang vertically,
but seems to make an angle relative to the vertical. Describe in
words where the tree leans relative to the vertical according to an
observer inside the car. (Does it appear to lean left, or right?
Forward, or backward?) An analysis of the forces might help in your explanation.\hwendpart
%
(d) What angle does the pine-scented tree make with respect to the
vertical?
