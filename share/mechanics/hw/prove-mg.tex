(a) Why would it not make sense to say that the force of gravity
acting on an object equals $g$?\hwendpart
(b) Why would it not make sense to say that the force of gravity
acting on an object of mass $m$ equals $m$?\hwendpart
(c) Use Newton's second law to prove that the magnitude of the gravitational force acting
on an object of mass $m$ equals $mg$.
