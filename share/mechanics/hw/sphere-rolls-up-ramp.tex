A solid sphere of weight $W$ rolls without slipping up an incline at
an angle of $\theta$ (with respect to the horizontal). At the bottom
of the incline the center of mass of the sphere has translational
speed $v$. How far along the ramp does the sphere travel before
coming to rest (not vertical height, but distance along the ramp)?\answercheck
