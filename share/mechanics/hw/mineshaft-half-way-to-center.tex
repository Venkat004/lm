Approximate the earth's density as being constant.
(a) Find the gravitational field at a point P inside the earth and half-way between
the center and the surface. Express your result as a ratio $g_P/g_S$ relative to the
field we experience at the surface. (b) As a check on your answer, make sure that the
same reasoning leads to a reasonable result when the fraction 1/2 is replaced by
the value 0 (P being the earth's center) or the value 1 (P being a point on the surface).
