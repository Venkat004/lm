(a) The person with mass $m$ hangs from the rope, hauling the box of mass $M$ up a slope inclined
at an angle $\theta$. There is friction between the box and the slope, described by
the usual coefficients of friction. The pulley, however, is frictionless.
Find the magnitude of the box's acceleration.\answercheck\hwendpart

(c) Check the physical behavior of your answer in the special cases of
$M=0$ and $\theta=-90\degunit$.
