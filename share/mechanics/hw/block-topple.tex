A block of mass $m$ (uniformly distributed) and dimensions $2L \times
L$ is prevented from toppling over by a rope, making the same angle
with respect to the horizontal as the long end of the block. ($\theta
< \arctan(2) \approx 63.4\degunit$, which is another way of saying
that the block's center of mass lies to the right of the point of contact with the ground.)
