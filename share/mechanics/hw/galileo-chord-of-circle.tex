The figure shows a circle in a vertical plane, with two wires positioned
along chords of the circle. The top of each wire coincides with the
top of the circle. Beads slide frictionlessly on the wires. If the beads
are released simultaneously at the top, which one wins the race?
You will need the fact that the acceleration equals
