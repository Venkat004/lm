A Hot Wheels car is rolling along a horizontal track at speed $v_0 = 6.0\ \munit/\sunit$.
It then comes to a ramp inclined at an angle
$\theta = 30\degunit$ above the horizontal, and the car undergoes a
deceleration of $g \sin \theta = 4.9\ \munit / \sunit^2$ when moving
along the ramp. The track ends at the top of the ramp, so the car is launched into the air.
By the time the car reaches the top of the ramp, its
speed has gone down to $3.0\ \munit / \sunit$.\\
