Two atoms will interact through electrical forces between
their protons and electrons. One fairly good approximation
to the m4_ifelse(__pe,PE,[:potential energy:],[:electrical energy:]) is the Lennard-Jones formula,
\begin{equation*}
   __pe (r) = k\left[\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^{12}-2\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^{6}\right],
\end{equation*}
where $r$ is the center-to-center distance between the atoms and $k$ is a positive constant.
Show that (a) there is an equilibrium point at $r=a$,\hwendpart
(b) the equilibrium is stable, and\hwendpart
(c) the energy required to bring
the atoms from their equilibrium separation to infinity is
$k$. <% hw_hint("lennardjones") %>
