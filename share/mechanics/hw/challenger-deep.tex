<% hw_solution %> (a) Atmospheric pressure at sea level is $101\ \zu{kPa}$. 
The deepest spot in the world's oceans is a valley called the Challenger Deep, in the Marianas Trench,
with a depth of $11.0\ \zu{km}$. Find the pressure at this depth, in units of atmospheres. Although
water under this amount of pressure does compress by a few percent, assume for the purposes of this
problem that it is incompressible.\\
(b) Suppose that an air bubble is formed at this depth and then rises to the surface. Estimate the
change in its volume and radius.
