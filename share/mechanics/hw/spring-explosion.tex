Two blocks, each of mass $M$, are connected by a thread and
moving with speed $v_0$. Between them is also a spring of spring constant
$k$, and it is compressed a distance $x$ (so that the tension in the
thread is $kx$). Suddenly, the thread breaks, and the spring relaxes
to its equilibrium length. Find the speed of the block that is pushed forward
by the spring.
