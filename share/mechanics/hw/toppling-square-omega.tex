(a) Find the moment of inertia of a uniform square of mass $m$ and with sides of length $b$,
for rotation in its own plane, about one of its corners.\\
(b) The square is balanced on one corner on a frictionless surface. An infinitesimal perturbation
causes it to topple. Find its angular velocity at the moment when its side slaps the surface.
