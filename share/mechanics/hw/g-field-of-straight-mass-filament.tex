Problems \ref{hw:g-field-of-straight-mass-filament}-\ref{hw:g-field-of-curved-mass-filament} all investigate the following idea.
Cosmological surveys at the largest observable distance scales have
detected structures like filaments. As an idealization of such a structure, consider a
uniform mass distribution lying along the entire $x$ axis, with mass density $\lambda$
in units of $\kgunit/\munit$. The purpose of this problem is to 
find the gravitational field created by this structure at a distance $y$.\\
(a) Determine as much as possible about the form of the solution, based on units.\hwendpart
(b) To evaluate the actual result, find the contribution $\der g_y$ to the $y$ component of the field arising
from the mass $\der m$ lying between $x$ and $x+\der x$, then integrate it.
