The earth is divided into solid inner core, a liquid outer core, and a plastic mantle.
Physical properties such as density change discontinuously at the boundaries between
one layer and the next. Although the density is not completely constant within each
region, we will approximate it as being so for the purposes of this problem. 
(We neglect the crust as well.) Let $R$
be the radius of the earth as a whole and $M$ its mass. The
following table gives a model of some properties of the three layers, as determined
by methods such as the observation of earthquake waves that have propagated from one
side of the planet to the other.

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\emph{region} & \emph{outer radius/$R$} & \emph{mass/$M$} \\
mantle &        1                       & 0.69 \\
outer core &    0.55                    & 0.29 \\
inner core &    0.19                    & 0.017
\end{tabular}

The boundary between the mantle and the outer core is referred to as the
Gutenberg discontinuity. Let $g_s$ be the strength of the earth's gravitational
field at its surface and $g_G$ its value at the Gutenberg discontinuity.
Find $g_G/g_s$.\answercheck
