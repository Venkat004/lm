When an object slides frictionlessly down a plane inclined at an angle
$\theta$, its acceleration equals $g\sin\theta$.
Suppose that a person on a bike is to coast down a ramp, starting from
rest, and then coast back up an identical ramp, tracing a ``V.'' The
horizontal distance is fixed to be $2w$, and we want to set the depth of the ``V'' so as to
achieve the minimal possible value $t^*$ for the total time.\\
(a) Based only on units, infer the form of the expression for $t^*$ in terms
of $w$, up to a unitless multiplicative constant.\hwendpart
(b) Find the angle that minimizes the time.\hwendpart
(c) Complete the determination of $t^*$ by finding the unitless constant.
