Label the following statements about vectors as true or false.\\
%
(a) The angle between $a \hat{\vc{x}} + b \hat{\vc{y}}$ and $b \hat{\vc{x}} + a \hat{\vc{y}}$ is
zero.\hwendpart
%
(b) The three vectors $\vc{A}$, $\vc{B}$, and $\vc{A}+\vc{B}$ form a
triangle.\hwendpart
%
(c) The three vectors $\vc{A}$, $\vc{B}$, and $\vc{A}-\vc{B}$ form a
triangle.\hwendpart
%
(d) The cross product between two vectors is always perpendicular to
each of the two vectors.\hwendpart
%
(e) If the angle between two vectors is greater than $90\degunit$,
then the dot product between the two vectors is negative.\hwendpart
%
(f) A unit vector has magnitude 1 (and no units).
