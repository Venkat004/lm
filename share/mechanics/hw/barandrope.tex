(a) The bar of mass $m$ is attached at the wall with a hinge, and is supported
on the right by a massless cable. Find the tension, $T$, in the cable in terms of
the angle $\theta$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Interpreting your answer to part a, what would be the best angle to use if we
wanted to minimize the strain on the cable?\hwendpart
(c) Again interpreting your answer to part a, for what angles does the result
misbehave mathematically? Interpet this physically.
