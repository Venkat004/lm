A Hot Wheels car is rolling along a horizontal track at speed $v_0$.
It then comes to a ramp inclined at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal.
The car undergoes a
deceleration of $g \sin \theta$ while rolling up the ramp. The track ends
after a distance $L$, so the car is launched into the air.\\
