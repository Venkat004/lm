A Hot Wheels car is rolling along a horizontal track at speed $v_0$.
It then comes to a ramp inclined at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal.
The car undergoes a
deceleration of $g \sin \theta$ while rolling up the ramp. The track ends
after a distance $L$, so the car is launched into the air.\\

(a) What is the speed of the car when it leaves the ramp?\answercheck\hwendpart

(b) How high does the car get in the air?\answercheck\hwendpart

(c) Find the angle of the ramp which maximizes the height found in part b.
You should find that there are two qualitatively different cases, depending on whether
$v_0$ is greater than or less than a certain critical value. The computerized answer check
is for the case where $v_0$ is small.\answercheck
