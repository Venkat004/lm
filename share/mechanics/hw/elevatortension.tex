(a) Let $T$ be the maximum tension that an elevator's
cable can withstand without breaking, i.e., the maximum force
it can exert. If the motor is programmed to give the car an
acceleration $a$ ($a>0$ is upward), what is the maximum mass that the car can
have, including passengers, if the cable is not to break?\answercheck\hwendpart

(b) Interpret the equation you derived in the special cases
of $a=0$ and of a downward acceleration of magnitude $g$.

(``Interpret'' means
to analyze the behavior of the equation, and connect that to reality, as
in the self-check on page \pageref{sc:interpret-terminal-v}.)
