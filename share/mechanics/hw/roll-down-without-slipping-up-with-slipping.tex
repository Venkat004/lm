A sphere of mass $M$ and radius $R$ is not necessarily solid or
hollow. It has moment of inertia $I = c MR^2$. As shown in the figure,
the sphere starts from rest and rolls without slipping down a ramp
from height $H$. It then moves back up the other side, but now with no
friction at all between the sphere and the ramp. What height does the
sphere reach?\answercheck
