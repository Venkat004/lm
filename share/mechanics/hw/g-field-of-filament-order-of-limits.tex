Let us slightly change the physical situation described in problem \ref{hw:g-field-of-straight-mass-filament},
letting the filament have a finite size, while retaining its symmetry under rotation about the $x$ axis. The
details don't actually matter very much for our purposes, but if we like, we can take the mass density to
be constant within a cylinder of radius $b$ centered on the $x$ axis. Now consider the following two
limits:
\begin{align*}
  g_1 &= \lim_{y\rightarrow0} \lim_{b\rightarrow0} g \qquad \text{and}\\
  g_2 &= \lim_{b\rightarrow0} \lim_{y\rightarrow0} g. 
\end{align*}
Each of these is a limit inside another limit, the only difference being the order of the limits.
Either of these could be used as a definition of the field at a point \emph{on} an infinitely
thin filament. Do they agree?
