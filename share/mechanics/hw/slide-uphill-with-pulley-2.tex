The physical situation is the same as in problem \ref{hw:slide-uphill-with-pulley},
except that we make different assumptions about friction.
%
(a) Suppose that there is no friction between the block and the ramp.
Find the value of $m$ so that the system is in equilibrium.\hwendpart
%
(b) If there is instead a coefficient of static friction $\mu_\text{s}$
between the block and the interface, find the minimum and maximum
values that $m$ can have so that the blocks remain at rest.
