A bullet of mass $m$ strikes a block of mass $M$ which is hanging by
a string of length $L$ from the ceiling. It is observed that, after the sticky collision,
the maximum angle that the string makes with the vertical is $\theta$.
This setup is called a ballistic pendulum, and it can be used to measure
the speed of the bullet.\\
