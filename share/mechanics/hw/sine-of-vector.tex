<% hw_solution %>  Suppose someone proposes a new operation in which a vector $\vc{A}$
is used to produce a new vector $\vc{B}$ like this:
\begin{align*}
  B_x &= \sin A_x  \\
  B_y &= \sin A_y  \\
  B_z &= \sin A_z 
\end{align*}
Prove that this operation won't be useful in physics, because it's not
rotationally invariant.
