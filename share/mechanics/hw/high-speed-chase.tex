When the police engage in a high-speed chase on city streets, it can be extremely
dangerous both to the police and to other motorists and pedestrians.
Suppose that the police car must travel at a speed that is limited by
the need to be able to stop before hitting a baby carriage, and that
the distance at which the driver first sees the baby carriage is
fixed. Tests show that in a panic stop from high speed,
a police car based on a Chevy Impala has a deceleration 9\%
greater than that of a Dodge Intrepid. Compare the maximum safe
speeds for the two cars.\answercheck
