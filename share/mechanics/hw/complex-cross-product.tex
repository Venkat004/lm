A certain function $f$ takes two vectors as inputs and gives an output that is also a vector.
The function can be defined in such a way that it is rotationally invariant, and it is also
well defined regardless of the units of the vectors.
It takes on the following values for the following inputs:
\begin{align*}
f(\hat{\vc{x}},\hat{\vc{y}})&=-\hat{\vc{z}} \\
f(2\hat{\vc{x}},\hat{\vc{y}})&=-8\hat{\vc{z}} \\
f(\hat{\vc{x}},2\hat{\vc{y}})&=-2\hat{\vc{z}}
\end{align*}
Prove that the given information uniquely determines $f$, and give an explicit expression for it.
