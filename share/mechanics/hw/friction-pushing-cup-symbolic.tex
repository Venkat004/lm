A cup of mass $M$ is pushed along a horizontal surface (and we will
\emph{not} ignore the effects of friction). Suppose that there is a
horizontal applied force on the cup of magnitude $F$, but the cup
only accelerates with magnitude $F/3M$ because of a second,
horizontal force of friction acting on the cup. What is the magnitude
of the frictional force (acting in the opposite direction to the
applied force)?
