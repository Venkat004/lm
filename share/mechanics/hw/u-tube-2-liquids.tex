A U-shaped tube, with both ends exposed to the atmosphere, has two
immiscible liquids in it: water, and some unknown liquid. The unknown liquid
sits on top of the water on the right side of the tube in a column of
height $H$. Also, the water extends a height $h$ above the
unknown-water interface. If the density of water is $\rho_\text{w}$,
what is the density of the unknown liquid?\answercheck
