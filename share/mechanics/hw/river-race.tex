Andr\'es and Brenda are going to race to see who can first get to a
town across a river of width $20.0\ \munit$. The water in the river is
moving at a constant $0.60\ \munit/\sunit$, each person can swim with
speed $1.00\ \munit/\sunit$ with respect to the water, and each
person can run $4.00\ \munit/\sunit$ on land.

Andr\'es is going to row in such a way that he moves straight towards
the town across the river. Brenda, however, decides to get to the
other side of the river as quickly as she can, and run.\\
