Decide whether the following statements regarding work and energy are true or false.\\
%
(a) The work done by a frictional force depends only on the initial
and final points of the path of a particle.\hwendpart
%
(b) If a force is perpendicular to the direction of motion of an
object, the force is not changing the kinetic energy of the
object.\hwendpart
%
(c) The work done by a conservative force is zero.\hwendpart
%
(d) Doubling the amount of time a force is applied will double the
work done on an object by the force.\hwendpart
%
(e) Since KE is always positive, the net work on a particle must be
positive.
