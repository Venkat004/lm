A yo-yo of total mass $m$ consists of two solid
cylinders of radius $R$, connected by a small spindle of
negligible mass and radius $r$. The top of the string is
held motionless while the string unrolls from the spindle.
Show that the acceleration of the yo-yo is $g/(1+R^2/2r^2)$.
[Hint: The acceleration and the tension in the string are
unknown. Use $\tau =\Delta L/\Delta t$ and $F=ma$
to determine these two unknowns.]
