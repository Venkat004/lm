In the figure, the rock climber has finished the climb, and his
partner is lowering him back down to the ground at
approximately constant speed. The following is a student's analysis of
the forces acting \emph{on the climber}. The arrows give the directions of the
forces.

\begin{tabular}{p{90mm}}
force of the earth's gravity, $\downarrow$ \\
force from the partner's hands, $\uparrow$ \\
force from the rope, $\uparrow$ \\
\end{tabular}

The student says that since the climber is moving down, the sum of the
two upward forces must be slightly less than the downward force of
gravity.

Correct all mistakes in the above analysis.
