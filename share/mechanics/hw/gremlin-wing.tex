The pressure at 11,000 meters (where most commercial airliners fly) is
about a quarter of atmospheric pressure at sea level. Suppose you're a
passenger on a plane, flying at such an altitude but with the cabin
pressurized to 1 atm, and you notice a gremlin on the wing. Suppose
that the window near your seat isn't screwed in and is held in place
only by the difference in pressure.  What force would the gremlin need
to exert on your $40\ \zu{cm}\times 50\ \zu{cm}$ window in order to
get in? \answercheck
