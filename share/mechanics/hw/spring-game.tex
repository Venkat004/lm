Some kids are playing a game where they shoot an object of mass $m$
off a spring into a cup that is a distance $D$ away from the base of
the table (see figure). The mass starts at a height $H$, and the
spring has spring constant $k$. What is the distance you should
compress the spring so that the projectile lands in the cup?\answercheck
