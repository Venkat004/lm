Some kids are playing a game where they shoot a ball of mass $m$
off a spring into a cup that is a distance $D$ away from the base of
the table (see figure). The ball starts at a height $H$, and the
spring has spring constant $k$.  The goal of the problem is to find the distance you should
compress the spring so that the ball lands in the cup.\\
