Your friend, who's kind of an idiot, jumps out of a third-story
window. After falling $7.0\ \munit$, he lands on his stomach so that
as his body compresses on impact, his center of mass only moves
$0.020\ \munit$. What is the
average force of the ground on your friend as he smacks the floor?
Express your answer in terms of his weight $W$.\answercheck
