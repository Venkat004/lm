(a) A block is sitting on a wedge inclined at an angle $\theta$ with respect to horizontal.
Someone grabs the wedge and moves it horizontally with acceleration $a$. The motion is in the
direction shown by the arrow in the figure. Find the maximum acceleration
that can be applied without causing the block to slide downhill.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Show that your answer to part a has the right units.\hwendpart
(c) Show that it also has the right dependence on $\theta$, by comparing its   
mathematical behavior to its physically expected behavior.
