The figure shows a slab of mass $M$ rolling freely down an inclined plane inclined
at an angle $\theta$ to the horizontal. The slab is on top of a set of rollers, each of radius $r$,
that roll without slipping at their top and bottom surfaces. The rollers may for example be
cylinders, or spheres such as ball bearings. Each roller's center of mass coincides with its
geometrical center. The sum of the masses of the rollers is $m$,
and the sum of their moments of inertia (each about its own center) is $I$.
Find the acceleration of the slab, and verify that your expression has the correct
behavior in interesting limiting cases.\answercheck
