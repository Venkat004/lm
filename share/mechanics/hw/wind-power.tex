Example \ref{eg:wind-power-density} on page \pageref{eg:wind-power-density}
showed that the power produced by a wind turbine is proportional to the cube
of the wind speed $v$. Von K\'arm\'an found empirically that when a fluid
flows turbulently over a surface, the speed of the fluid is often well approximated
by $v\propto z^{1/7}$, where $z$ is the distance from the surface. Wind turbine
towers are often constructed at heights of 50 m, but surveys of wind speeds are
usually conducted at heights of about 3 m. By what factor should the
predicted wind power density be scaled up relative to the survey data?\answercheck
