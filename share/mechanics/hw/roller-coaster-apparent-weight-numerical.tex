A roller coaster starts from rest and descends 35 meters in its
initial drop and then rises 23 meters before going over a
hill. A passenger at the top of the hill feels an apparent weight
which is 2/3 of her normal weight.
By using the fact that the energy loss due to friction must be greater than zero,
find a bound on the radius of curvature of
the first hill. Is this an
upper bound, or a lower bound?\answercheck
