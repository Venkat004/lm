The multiflash photograph shows a collision
between two pool balls. The ball that was initially at rest
shows up as a dark image in its initial position, because
its image was exposed several times before it was struck and
began moving. By making \emph{measurements} on the figure,
determine \emph{numerically} whether or not energy appears to have been
conserved in the collision. What systematic effects would
limit the accuracy of your test? [From an example in PSSC Physics.]
