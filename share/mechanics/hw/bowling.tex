Suppose a bowling ball is initially thrown so that it
has no angular momentum at all, i.e., it is initially just
sliding down the lane. Eventually kinetic friction will
get it spinning fast enough so that it is
rolling without slipping. Show that the final velocity of
the ball equals 5/7 of its initial velocity. [Hint: You'll
need the result of problem \ref{hw:rolling-ratio}.]
