A slab of mass $M$ sits on top of a set of ball bearings or cylindrical rollers
of radius $r$.
The total mass of the rollers is $m$, and the sum of their moments of inertia,
about their own centers, is $I$. The whole assembly is rolling without slipping down a plane
inclined at an angle $\theta$. The rollers don't touch each other, so there
is no kinetic friction between them. Find the acceleration and interpret 
the dependence of the result on $M$ and $m$.
