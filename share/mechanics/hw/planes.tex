        A learjet traveling due east at 300 mi/hr collides with
        a jumbo jet which was heading southwest at 150 mi/hr. The
        jumbo jet's mass is five times greater than that of the
        learjet. When they collide, the learjet sticks into the
        fuselage of the jumbo jet, and they fall to earth together.
        Their engines stop functioning immediately after the
        collision. On a map, what will be the direction from the
        location of the collision to the place where the wreckage
        hits the ground? (Give an angle.)\answercheck
