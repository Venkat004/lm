Decide whether the following statements about
one-dimensional motion are true or false:\\
%
(a) The area under a $v(t)$ curve gives the acceleration of the
object.\hwendpart
%
(b) The area under a $a(t)$ curve gives the change in velocity of the
object.\hwendpart
%
(c) The slope of a $a(t)$ curve at time $T$ is the value
$v(T)$.\hwendpart
%
(d) The slope of the $v(t)$ curve at time $T$ is the value
$a(T)$.\hwendpart
%
(e) The displacement $\Delta x$ from $t_1$ to $t_2$ is equal to the
area under the $a(t)$ curve from $t_1$ to $t_2$.
