Consider the same pneumatic piston described in problem \ref{hw:piston},
but now imagine that the oscillations are
not small. Sketch a graph of the total force on the piston
as it would appear over this wider range of motion. For a
wider range of motion, explain why the vibration of the
piston about equilibrium is not simple harmonic motion, and
sketch a graph of $x$ vs $t$, showing roughly how the curve
is different from a sine wave. [Hint: Acceleration
corresponds to the curvature of the $x-t$ graph, so if the
force is greater, the graph should curve around more quickly.]
