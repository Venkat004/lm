A rod of length $b$ and mass $m$ stands upright. We want
to strike the rod at the bottom, causing it to fall and land flat.\\
(a) Find the momentum, $p$, that should be delivered, in terms of $m$, $b$,
and $g$. [Hint: the solution is nearly determined by units.]\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Can this really be done without having the rod scrape on the floor?
