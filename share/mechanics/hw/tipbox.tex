The box shown in the figure is being accelerated by
pulling on it with the rope.\hwendpart
(a) Assume the floor is frictionless.
What is the maximum force that can be applied without causing
the box to tip over?<% hw_hint("tipbox") %>\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Repeat part a, but now let the coefficient of friction
be $\mu$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) What happens to your answer to part b when the box is sufficiently
tall? How do you interpret this?
