Many fish have an organ known as a swim bladder, an
air-filled cavity whose main purpose is to control the
fish's buoyancy and allow it to keep from rising or sinking
without having to use its muscles. In some fish, however,
the swim bladder (or a small extension of it) is linked to
the ear and serves the additional purpose of amplifying
sound waves. For a typical fish having such an anatomy, the
bladder has a resonant frequency of 300 Hz, the bladder's
$Q$ is 3, and the maximum amplification is about a factor of
100 in energy. Over what range of frequencies would the
amplification be at least a factor of 50?
