        The figure shows two unequal masses, $M$ and $m$, connected by
        a string running over a pulley. This system was analyzed previously
        in problem \ref{hw:atwood} on p.~\pageref{hw:atwood}, using Newton's
laws.\\ (a) Analyze the system using conservation of energy instead. Find the
speed the weights gain after being released from rest and traveling a distance
$h$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Use your result from part a to find the acceleration, reproducing the
result of the earlier problem.\answercheck\hwendpart
