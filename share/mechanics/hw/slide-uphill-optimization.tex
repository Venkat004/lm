You are pushing a box up a ramp that is at an angle $\theta$ with
respect to the horizontal. Friction acts between the box and the ramp,
with coefficient $\mu$. Suppose that your force is fixed in magnitude,
but can be applied at any desired angle $\varphi$ above the horizontal.
Find the optimal value of $\varphi$.\answercheck
