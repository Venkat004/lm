A bug stands on a horizontal turntable at distance $r$ from the center.
The coefficient of static friction between the bug and the turntable
is $\mu_s$. Starting from rest, the turntable begins rotating with
angular acceleration $\alpha$. What is the magnitude of the angular frequency at which
the bug starts to slide?
