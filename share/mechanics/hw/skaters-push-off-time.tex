Ice skaters with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ push off from each other with a constant
  force $F$, which lasts until they lose contact. The distance between their centers of mass is 
  $\ell_\zu{0}$ initially and $\ell_f$ when they lose contact.\\
%
(a) Find the amount of time $T$  for which they remain in contact.\hwendpart
(b) Show that your answer in part a has units that make sense.\hwendpart
(c) Show that your answer has the right dependence on $F$.\hwendpart
(d) Interpret the case where one of the masses is very small.\hwendpart
