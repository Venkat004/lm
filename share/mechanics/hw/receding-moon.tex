As is discussed in more detail in 
example \ref{eg:tidal-slowdown} on p.~\pageref{eg:tidal-slowdown},
tidal interactions with the earth are causing the
moon's orbit to grow gradually larger. Laser beams bounced
off of a mirror left on the moon by astronauts have allowed
a measurement of the moon's rate of recession, which is
about 1 cm per year. This means that the gravitational force
acting between earth and moon is decreasing. By what
fraction does the force decrease with each 27-day orbit?
