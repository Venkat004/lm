A drinking straw works because, when you suck air out of the straw, there is
decreased pressure. The equilibrium water level inside the straw is
such that the pressure at the water level outside the straw
(atmospheric pressure) is equal to the pressure at the same height
inside the straw. Inside the straw, there are two contributions: the
air pressure inside the straw plus the column of water above this
height.\\
