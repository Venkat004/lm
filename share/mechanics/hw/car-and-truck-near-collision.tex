You're in your Honda, cruising on the freeway at velocity $u$, when, up ahead at distance $L$, a Ford
pickup truck cuts in front of you while moving at constant velocity $u/2$.
Like half the speed that any reasonable person would go!
Let positive $x$ be the direction of motion, and let your position be
$x=0$ at $t=0$.
To avoid a collision, you immediately slam on the brakes and start decelerating with
acceleration $-a$, where $a$ is a positive constant.\\

(a) Write an equation for
$x_\text{F}(t)$, the position of the Ford as a function of time,
as they trundle onward obliviously.\answercheck\hwendpart

(b) Write an equation for $x_\text{H}(t)$, the
position of your Honda as a function of time.\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(c) By subtracting one from the other, find an expression for the
distance between the two vehicles as a function of time, $d(t)$.\answercheck\hwendpart
