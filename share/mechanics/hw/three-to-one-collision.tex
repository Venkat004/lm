        A ball of mass $3m$ collides head-on with an initially stationary ball of
        mass $m$. No kinetic energy is transformed into heat or sound. In what direction
        is the mass-$3m$ ball moving after the collision, and how fast is it going
        compared to its original velocity?\answercheck
