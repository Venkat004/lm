An airplane is in a nosedive. In order not to crash, the pilot pulls
up as much as she can. At the lowest point of the plane's trajectory,
the plane is in a circular arc of radius $300\ \munit$, and the pilot
experiences an acceleration of $5.0g$ (so that her weight feels like
six times normal). What is the plane's speed at this
point?\answercheck
