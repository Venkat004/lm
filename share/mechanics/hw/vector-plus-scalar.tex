Suppose someone proposes a new operation in which a vector $\vc{A}$ and
a scalar $B$ are added together to make a new vector $\vc{C}$ like this:
\begin{align*}
  C_x &= A_x + B \\
  C_y &= A_y + B \\
  C_z &= A_z + B 
\end{align*}
Prove that this operation won't be useful in physics, because it's not
rotationally invariant.
