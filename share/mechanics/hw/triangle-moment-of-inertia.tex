Let two sides of a triangle be given by the vectors $\vc{A}$ and $\vc{B}$, with their tails
at the origin, and
let mass $m$ be uniformly distributed
on the interior of the triangle.
(a) Show that the distance of the triangle's center of mass from the intersection
of sides $\vc{A}$ and $\vc{B}$ is given by $\frac{1}{3}|\vc{A}+\vc{B}|$.\hwendpart
(b) Consider the quadrilateral with mass $2m$, and vertices at the origin, $\vc{A}$, $\vc{B}$, and $\vc{A}+\vc{B}$.
Show that its moment of inertia, for rotation about an axis perpendicular to it and passing through its center of mass,
is $\frac{m}{6}(A^2+B^2)$.\hwendpart
(c) Show that the moment of inertia for rotation about an axis perpendicular to
the plane of the original triangle, and passing through its center of mass, is $\frac{m}{18}(A^2+B^2-\vc{A}\cdot\vc{B})$.
Hint: Combine the results of parts a and b with the result of problem \ref{hw:parallel-axis-theorem}.
