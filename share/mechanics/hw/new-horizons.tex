On Feb. 28, 2007, the New Horizons space probe, on its way to a 2015 flyby of Pluto,
passed by the planet Jupiter for a gravity-assisted maneuver that increased its speed
and changed its course. The dashed line in the figure shows the spacecraft's trajectory,
which is curved because of three forces: the force of the exhaust gases from the probe's
own engines, the sun's gravitational force, and Jupiter's gravitational force.
Find the magnitude of the total gravitational force acting on the probe.
You will find that the sun's force is much smaller than Jupiter's, so that the
magnitude of the total force is determined almost entirely by Jupiter's force.
However, this is a high-precision problem, and you will find that the total
force is slightly different from Jupiter's force.\answercheck
