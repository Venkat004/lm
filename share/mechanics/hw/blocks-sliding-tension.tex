Blocks $M_1$ and $M_2$ are stacked as shown, with $M_2$ on top. $M_2$
is connected via a string to the wall, and $M_1$ is pulled to the
right with an applied force $F_\text{app}$ big enough to get $M_1$ to
move. The coefficient of kinetic friction has the same value $\mu_k$ among all surfaces
(i.e., the block-block and ground-block interfaces).\\
%
(a) Analyze the forces in which each block participates, as in
m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:section \ref{sec:newton-2-analysis-of-forces}:],[:__subsection_or_section(analysis-of-forces):]).\hwendpart
%
(b) Determine the tension in the string.\hwendpart
%
(c) Find the acceleration of the block of mass $M_1$.
