A silk thread is uniformly charged by rubbing it with llama fur.
The thread is then dangled vertically above a metal plate and
released. As each part of the thread makes contact with the conducting
plate, its charge is deposited onto the plate. Since the thread is
accelerating due to gravity, the rate of charge deposition increases
with time, and by time $t$ the cumulative amount of charge is $q=ct^2$,
where $c$ is a constant. (a) Find the current flowing onto the plate.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Suppose that the charge is immediately carried away through a resistance $R$.
Find the power dissipated as heat.\answercheck\hwendpart
