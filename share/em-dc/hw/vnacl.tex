<% hw_hint("vnacl") %>Referring back to problem \ref{hw:nacl}, p.~\pageref{hw:nacl},
about the sodium chloride crystal, suppose the lithium ion
is going to jump from the gap it is occupying to one of the
four closest neighboring gaps.  Which one will it jump to,
and if it starts from rest, how fast will it be going by the
time it gets there?  (It will keep on moving and accelerating
after that, but that does not concern us.) 
You will need the result of problem \ref{hw:pe-of-point-charges}.\answercheck
