It's fairly common in electrical circuits for additional, undesirable resistances to occur
because of factors such as dirty, corroded, or loose connections. Suppose that a device
with resistance $R$ normally dissipates power $P$, but due to an additional series resistance $r$
the \emph{total} power is reduced to $P'$. We might, for example, detect this change because
the battery powering our device ran down more quickly than normal. \\
(a) Find the unknown resistance $r$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Check that the units of your result make sense.\hwendpart
(c) Check that your result makes sense in the special cases $P'=P$ and $P'=0$.
