The figure shows a circuit containing five lightbulbs
connected to a battery. Suppose you're going to connect one
probe of a voltmeter to the circuit at the point marked with
a dot. How many unique, nonzero voltage differences could
you measure by connecting the other probe to other
wires in the circuit?
